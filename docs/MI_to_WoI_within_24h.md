# 🧠 MI → WoI within 24h
*"When meaning became measurable."*

It started as a simple test.  
Mutual Information (MI) had always been my comfort zone — elegant, explainable, statistically pure.  
But it lacked one thing: **intent**.  
MI tells you *how much* two variables share, but never *why*.  

Somewhere between too little sleep and too much Coca-Cola, something clicked.  
If information can be shared, it can also be **weighted** — not just by probability, but by **semantic importance**.  
That’s how *Words of Importance (WoI)* was born.  

No deep learning.  
No GPUs.  
Just a MacBook Air, a few thousand wine reviews, and a chaotic mind obsessed with structure.

## From Mutual Information to Measured Meaning

MI measures dependence between X and Y — good.  
But what if X is a *word* and Y is a *context that shifts*?  
MI can’t see the *meaning drift*, it’s blind to language as a living system.  

So I added weight.  
Each token got its own *information density*, derived from how often it connects *semantically* across classes.  
The result wasn’t another numeric feature — it was a **semantic fingerprint**.  

The encoder no longer asked *“Is this word correlated?”*  
It asked: *“How much does this word matter?”*  

That’s when I realized — I hadn’t just encoded data.  
I’d encoded **meaning**.

## Within 24 Hours

What started as a debug run turned into a revelation.  
A 4,000-word bag became a compressed universe of weighted meaning.  
Accuracy rose, entropy fell — and so did my skepticism.  

The first logistic regression hit 0.81 accuracy.  
But the number didn’t matter.  
It was the pattern: the **WoI curve** was self-organizing.  
Information *found its own balance*.  

I wasn’t tuning parameters.  
I was witnessing emergence.

## A Note to the Future

WoI isn’t just a model — it’s a **statement**.  
That *semantic transparency* and *compression* don’t have to be opposites.  
That meaning can be **measured, stored, and regenerated** without losing its soul.  

No transformer, no black box.  
Just words, weights, and intent.  

If someone ever asks what WoI really is —  
tell them it’s Mutual Information that *found its purpose*.
