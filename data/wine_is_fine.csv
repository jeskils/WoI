0,France,"Structured and very rich, this has sweet tannins that provide weight while retaining the wine's ripe, fruity character. It has a solid, firm texture, and the wood influence gives a burst of firm toast. Age for 4–5 years.",90,16.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Lauduc,Red,1.0,0.0
1,Argentina,"Fairly ripe, full and attractive, with dark plum aromas. The palate has bounce, jump and a bit of acidic sharpness, while the plum and berry flavors are generic but good. Sweet on the finish; standard and healthy stuff.",85,9.0,Malbec,Acordeón,Red,1.0,0.0
2,Uruguay,"Deep and baked on the nose, with soft, fleshy blackberry and plum flavors. On the palate the wine's tannins are tame and the fruit seems exceedingly rich.  So drink now to get its last gasp of gusto; soon it will probably turn heavier that it is now.",84,17.0,Tannat,Castillo Viejo,Red,1.0,0.0
3,Italy,"As its name suggests, Ser Gioveto is a wine that celebrates Sangiovese winemaking tradition in Tuscany. The wine is fresh, soft and smooth. It's also packed tight with delicious berry flavors.",90,52.0,Sangiovese,Rocca delle Macìe,Red,1.0,0.0
4,Greece,"An unusual blend of 60% Tannat and 40% Montepulciano, the first from Greece (or anywhere), this has a beautiful nose of cured meat, fresh crushed berries, and vibrant vanilla. Tannat's heavy tannins are present, as is plentiful acidity. Dark purple fruit and vanilla flavors are pure and modern, but this wine would be better if it wasn't so tart.",86,65.0,Red Blend,Alpha Estate,Red,1.0,0.0
5,Chile,"This opens with classically Chilean aromas of bell pepper, olive and berry. It feels firm and tightly wound, with plum and herb flavors. Despite its herbal quality and its peppery, briary finish, the wine nevertheless manages not to taste green.",88,15.0,Cabernet Franc,Lomas del Valle,Red,1.0,0.0
6,US,"The burn of alcohol and natural black pepper spice give this wine a sting. Based on Grenache and Sangiovese, with some Zinfandel, it's rich in black and red currant and cola flavors.",86,26.0,Red Blend,Blanchard Family,Red,1.0,0.0
7,Austria,"Slight pepper spice mingles with subdued, tart berry fruit on the nose of this wine. The palate adds supple vanilla and strawberry notes, with fine, smooth tannins and pervasive freshness. For now, the vanilla still dominates, but a little bottle age will help. Drink 2018–2022.",92,14.0,Pinot Noir,Markowitsch,Red,1.0,0.0
8,Chile,"A pure and proper Cabernet with aromas of balsam wood, toast, berry and cassis. There's some power and kick on the palate, but the overall feel is good. So are the flavors of cassis, raspberry and plum. Spicy on the finish, with a bit of piquant heat.",88,12.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Odfjell,Red,1.0,0.0
9,Italy,"With burnt popcorn as the lead scent and an herbal streak that can't be denied, Kendall-Jackson's attempt at Tuscan Cabernet Franc (with 18% Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiove) requires too much sacrifice. The flavors are of rhubarb and raspberry, with spice and tomato sauce along for the ride. Has size and potency, but not much charm.",83,96.0,Cabernet Blend,Tenuta di Arceno,Red,1.0,0.0
10,Australia,"Complex, albeit within a limited and rather dark spectrum that runs from cola and earth through to black olive and espresso. Full bodied, but seems to lack just a bit of midpalate texture, finishing crisp. Drink now–2018.",89,29.0,Shiraz,Koonowla,Red,1.0,0.0
11,US,"In the blend of this intensely fragrant young wine is 14% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Petit Verdot. I like the complexity, the way the primary fruits mix in unusual notes of pineapple along with the black cherry. It's resonant and tangy, with good, long flavors and lots of new oak. This was a year of winemaker transition, and may be the last of the real chocolaty wines from Northstar. Give this plenty of airing, or cellar it for another 3–4 years.",92,41.0,Merlot,Northstar,Red,1.0,0.0
12,US,"Here's another of Fess Parker's 2007 Pinots that wants time in the cellar. It's very young now, with a shroud of tannins masking Burgundian flavors of mushrooms, pine, cherries, blackberries, sandalwood, minerals and an enormous array of Asian spices. Best 2011–2015.",93,55.0,Pinot Noir,Fess Parker,Red,1.0,0.0
13,Greece,"This is a classic example of a good Greek red: fruit-forward cherry aromas with a touch of cedar and spice lead into an alluring combination of cinnamon spice and berry on the palate. Fresh but balanced, the wine will pair well with beef and game. Its tannic structure and length also offer ageability.",88,25.0,Red Blend,Palivou,Red,1.0,0.0
14,US,"A simple, straightforward Cab. It shows herb and green pepper amid clove and currant and it's low enough in alcohol not to mess you up. A perfectly fine everyday wine.",86,14.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Heron,Red,1.0,0.0
15,Italy,"Enticing blue flower, rose, new leather and graphite scents lead the nose. The vibrant if rather slender palate offers tart cherry, chopped herb and a saline note, framed by firm, fine-grained tannins.",89,26.0,Sangiovese,Folonari,Red,1.0,0.0
16,US,"This is a new brand from Jess Jackson. The wine is quite interesting—absolutely dry, very tannic, acidic and austere, with a bitterness to the cherryskin flavors. Yet it possesses polish and elegance. Work is needed, but this is a Merlot to watch.",88,35.0,Merlot,Pelton House,Red,1.0,0.0
17,Spain,"On the money right from the start, where deep aromas of black fruits, minerality and fresh herbs mingle nicely. The palate is creamy and smooth, with rich, almost syrupy berry, cream, coffee and toffee flavors. Oaked up but not “oaky,” with caramel and chocolate on the smooth finish. Drink now through 2015.",92,58.0,Red Blend,Torres,Red,1.0,0.0
18,US,"Benziger pulls out all the stops on this estate, Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, from their hilly vineyard above Glen Ellen. It's a beautiful effort. The flavors are very close to Napa Cab, namely deliciously sweet cassis, roasted coffee and cocoa, but there's a tannin and acid structure that in some respects outclasses even Napa's most prestigious chateaus. This is a great red wine.",94,65.0,Cabernet Blend,Benziger,Red,1.0,0.0
19,Chile,"Dark up front, with aromas of charcoal and crusty black fruits. Feels full but creamy, with black fruit flavors and oak-driven accents of butter and mocha. Warm and full, with licorice and dark berry flavors accenting a healthy feeling finish. Good Syrah for everyday drinking.",87,13.0,Syrah,Chilcas,Red,1.0,0.0
20,US,"This bottling comes off a select corner of the Talley family ranch and is quite shy on the nose at first, reluctantly offering beet, cranberry, and cooked strawberry aromas, with the slightest touch of caramelization and loam. The flavors tend toward bramble, with wild thyme, white pepper and oregano, starting off simple but growing persistent and beautiful as the wine opens.",92,64.0,Pinot Noir,Talley,Red,1.0,0.0
21,US,"Marred by unripe asparagus notes, this Syrah is tough to like despite its smooth tannins and some good blackberry and chocolate fruit.",82,25.0,Syrah,Firestone,Red,1.0,0.0
22,US,"Plenty of ripe, forward fruit here: It brims with cherries, blackberries and plums. Shows its Alexander Valley origin in the softness and herbaceousness that accompany the fruit. Drink up.",88,30.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Louis M. Martini,Red,1.0,0.0
23,US,"From one of Livermore's oldest producers, a small-production Petite Sirah, one of their specialties, all from an estate vineyard planted 40 years ago, this wine is super dark purple in color, very earthy, with nice chocolate and delicate fruit interspersed among the dusty tannins. Pretty and interesting.",87,25.0,Petite Sirah,Concannon,Red,1.0,0.0
24,US,"Swanson has a great track record with this wine, which is always in need of time on release. The 2005 shows classic Napa structure, with hard but near-perfect tannins and lush, oak-sweetened black currant, cherry and dark chocolate flavors. Brilliant, but will benefit from a good three or four years in the cellar. Should evolve well beyond 2012.",92,75.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Swanson,Red,1.0,0.0
25,Portugal,"This wine is just starting out. With its initially austere structure and firm tannins, the juicy fruitiness and mineral character are still waiting to emerge. It will be a serious and structured wine in the next few years, evoking the granite of the Douro. Drink from 2016.",91,16.0,Portuguese Red,José Maria da Fonseca,Red,1.0,0.0
26,France,"The small enclave of Buzet makes wines in a Bordeaux style, with black currant fruitiness and some firm tannins. This wine, now aging well, shows ripe juicy fruits, a solid dry core and refreshing, crisp acidity at the end.",88,20.0,Red Blend,Georges Vigouroux,Red,1.0,0.0
27,US,"A little sharp, with a sting throughout, but otherwise a fine, classic Cabernet brimming with flavor. Shows upfront blackberries, currants, chocolate-covered cherries, smoky vanilla and toast, wrapped into smooth, sturdy tannins. Could mellow and soften in the next several years.",88,33.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bardessono,Red,1.0,0.0
28,Austria,"An easy blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with fresh acidity and soft tannins. Flavors of red plums and black currants dominate, with a light hint of spice to finish.",85,8.0,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Lenz Moser,Red,1.0,0.0
29,Italy,"This blend of 50% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc opens with aromas of cherries, berries, blue flower, sun-baked earth and a hint of balsamic herbs. The ripe palate delivers fleshy black cherry, milk chocolate, espresso and black pepper alongside chewy tannins.",90,30.0,Red Blend,Ceralti,Red,1.0,0.0
30,Australia,"This is one pure, pretty, sturdy Cab. On the palate, black plum and berry fruit is front and center, with oak and caramel most evident on the finish and on the nose. Go ahead, show your guests some love and pour them something that won't overwhelm dinner.",89,30.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vasse Felix,Red,1.0,0.0
31,US,"QED stands for Quod Erat Demonstrandum (what was to be shown). A further motto on the label reads “the proof is in the bottle.” This is supple, almost voluptuous, dark, sappy, packed with compressed black fruits, streaked with iodine and coffee. It shows excellent length and opens with scents hinting of game, earth, sweet mocha, lead pencil and cedar. Complex and intriguing, with six or eight year aging potential. A very impressive debut.",94,50.0,Syrah,Rasa,Red,1.0,0.0
32,Portugal,"A powerful expression of Portuguese varieties, with dense tannins, dark fruit flavors and ripeness. If the alcohol is too high—and it shows in the pepper edge to the wine—it still has a sense of shape and structure.",88,18.0,Portuguese Red,Quinta de Chocapalha,Red,1.0,0.0
33,US,"A terrific vintage for the Freedom Hill bottling, the 2008 displays a firm, concentrated core of cranberry, raspberry and pie-cherry fruit flavors. Wrapped in plenty of toasty new oak, the wine is powerful and mouth-coating, balanced with juicy acidity, and rolls on through a lengthy, satisfying finish.",92,40.0,Pinot Noir,Panther Creek,Red,1.0,0.0
34,US,"A lush, forward Zin whose fruity sweetness is accentuated by pairing with soft cheeses. Dry and soft, it offers flavors of briary forest berries, anise, black pepper and smoky sandalwood. A fine evocation of a cool-climate Zinfandel, although the alcohol is quite high. Drink now.",87,28.0,Zinfandel,Dogwood,Red,1.0,0.0
35,Argentina,"A grassy, herbal element is up front on the nose of this Amarone-style blend done in conjunction with Allegrini of the the Veneto (Italy). In the mouth, it's round as a ball, with syrupy richness. Ripe sticky berry and plum flavors finish chewy with residual stickiness.",87,27.0,Red Blend,Bodega Renacer,Red,1.0,0.0
36,US,"This Merlot is as pale as a Pinot Noir, which suggests how light bodied it is. It's silky and dry in the mouth, with pleasant cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors.",84,12.0,Merlot,Montoya,Red,1.0,0.0
37,Chile,"Huge in color and body, with thickness and long legs. The nose has a minty green core that's surrounded by cassis, while the palate is extracted, round and tastes of bouncy young red fruits and boysenberry. Grippy and a little high in acid given the wine's full body and extract level.",87,24.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Ema,Red,1.0,0.0
38,France,"Owned by the Thomas family, this wine has an unusual blend of 50% Merlot and 35% Petit Verdot (with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon). It shows how Petit Verdot can now ripen easily in warm years. The dark color and dense tannins are a counterpoint to the juicy blackberry fruit. They will allow this wine to age well. Drink from 2021.",91,29.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Reverdi,Red,1.0,0.0
39,US,"Peppery and sandpapery, almost like Zinfandel, with briary blackberry flavors. Not especially complicated, but it's dry and clean, and a decent full-bodied red for ordinary occasions.",86,14.0,Merlot,Concannon,Red,1.0,0.0
40,New Zealand,"Hints of bay leaf and wild thyme provide complexity and lift to this dark-fruited, full-bodied wine. Black cherry, cola and mocha notes carry the midpalate, then finish with a velvety texture. Drink now–2018.",91,33.0,Pinot Noir,Kim Crawford,Red,1.0,0.0
41,US,"Quite an impressive wine, especially from this prestigious appellation at this price. Dry and full-bodied, it shows black cherry candy, currant, herb, anise and cedar flavors, wrapped into finely ground, dusty tannins. Fine now, and could even develop bottle complexity over the next 2-4 years.",89,22.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cameron Hughes,Red,1.0,0.0
42,US,"At 15.9% abv, this is a monster by Finger Lakes standards, but it's unsurprising perhaps for such a hot vintage. A tad jammy on the palate, it's sweet with red cherry fruit that's framed by herbaceous green notes and layers of soft, furry tannins.",86,30.0,Cabernet Franc,Lakewood,Red,1.0,0.0
43,US,"This aging Merlot is already showing mature flavors; the fruit is dropping away and leaving rather astringent tannins. Right now you've got a mix of plum, blueberry and cherry fruit, softened up but still present, so it's time to drink it up.",85,20.0,Merlot,Wineglass Cellars,Red,1.0,0.0
44,US,"Big, rich, jammy Shiraz, soft and sweet in blackberry and cherry jam, cola, caramelized wood and bacon flavors. This lusty red wine will be a good companion to barbecue.",85,30.0,Shiraz,Wattle Creek,Red,1.0,0.0
45,Chile,"One of the best Santa Carolina wines in years. The nose is big and floral, with tons of plum and berry. The mouth is packed tight and tastes great, with ripe cassis and a lot of chocolate to back things up. Finishes chewy and broad, with mocha and vanilla accents, yet there's still enough acidity to keep things moving. Very nice wine for the money.",90,15.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Carolina,Red,1.0,0.0
46,Argentina,"Bold berry aromas turn a little sweet and simple with airing, while the palate deals plum and berry flavors on a tight, tannic frame. Bright and colorful but fairly rough and basic in what it has to offer.",83,8.0,Merlot,Telteca,Red,1.0,0.0
47,France,"Normally one of the most elegant of Pauillacs, the 2003 is big and dense. These dark tannins mask delicious black fruit, flavors of spice and layers of acidity. This is going to develop relatively fast, despite the density of the wine, just because it is so rich. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",94,142.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande,Red,1.0,0.0
48,France,"This generous and full-bodied wine is full of juicy red berry fruits, ripe tannins and just enough structure to support its opulent character. Wood aging gives a fine-grained texture that will allow it to age. Drink from 2016.",89,25.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château la Chapelle aux Moines,Red,1.0,0.0
49,US,"Whiffs of mushroom and autumn leaf add complexity to this Pinot Noir's dried cherry, strawberry and violet aromas.

50,France,"A wine that shows rich blackberry fruits, already rounded and soft. It has a tannic structure that is embedded in the fruit, along with spice, toast and a firm finish. An ageworthy wine.",90,20.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Liversan,Red,1.0,0.0

53,US,"Richness alone would earn this Zinfandel a good score, but the overall balance uplifts it. It's simply delicious in wild berry, spice, mocha, salty bacon, vanilla toast and sandalwood flavors. Yet the tannins are fine, and the acidity is perfect. Even the slightly sweet finish and high alcohol work.",90,34.0,Zinfandel,Wilson,Red,1.0,0.0
54,US,"Ripe and sweet in cherry, chocolate and oak flavors, this Cabernet scores high in sheer deliciousness. It's a bit simple in structure, though, and unlikely to age, so drink up.",87,95.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bello Family Vineyards,Red,1.0,0.0

56,France,"A blend of 90% Grenache and 10% Syrah, all from vines averaging 80 years of age, this is a stupendously concentrated wine that still possesses nuance and complexity. Exotic spices—notably lavender and clove—scent the bouquet, while the huge palate boasts layers of plum fruit and thick, velvety tannins. Drinkable now, but probably at its best after 2012.",92,40.0,Rhône-style Red Blend,Château de Saint-Cosme,Red,1.0,0.0
57,US,"Polished cherry, blackberry and coffee fruit flavors comprise this Merlot. It's bone dry, with rich tannins and a smattering of oak. Has a jagged quality that's not likely to age out, but it's a pretty good wine.",85,15.0,Merlot,Jekel,Red,1.0,0.0
58,Australia,"Intensely toasty on the nose, along with powerful menthol notes that persist from start to finish. This full-bodied, almost syrupy-concentrated Shiraz features plums and blackberries that take on a slightly medicinal cast, finishing on a fresh, resiny note. Try after 2016.",89,175.0,Shiraz,Jim Barry,Red,1.0,0.0
59,Australia,"Has roasted, ripe flavors of prune or date, plus a hint of volatility on the nose. Has a dusty feel on the palate, with coffee, leather and blackberry flavors taking center stage.

60,US,"Lush and fragrant, and happily and distinctively not tasting like a Washington Cabernet or Merlot, this is a bowl of rose petals and ripe cherries. Strong acids, earthy tannins, slivers of chocolate and a finish of espresso all combine into a lovely and lasting set of flavors. 100% varietal, aged in neutral barrels.",88,28.0,Sangiovese,Andrew Will,Red,1.0,0.0

62,US,"The Les Collines vineyard provided the fruit; it brings Walla Walla Valley strawberry preserves and some sharp acids, but feels a bit thin and sharp in the midpalate.

63,Italy,"Aromas suggest oak, vanilla, plum, espresso and coconut. The tightly wound palate isn't very expressive but offers dried black fruit, roasted coffee bean and clove alongside raspy tannins, with the heat of alcohol on the close.",87,60.0,Sangiovese,Ferrero,Red,1.0,0.0
64,US,"Mostly Cabernet Sauvignon this wine also has small percentages of Malbec, Petite Sirah, Tannat and Petit Verdot thrown into the mix. The result is a smoky, barrel-influenced concoction emphasizing burly, tannic black- currant fruit.",84,15.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,James Mitchell,Red,1.0,0.0

66,Italy,"Kendall-Jackson's super Tuscan is Cab-based and very ripe. It's black as coal, with leather, earth and dark-fruit aromas.

68,US,"This Merlot is 100% varietal, a blend of Horse Heaven Hills, Yakima Valley and Walla Walla Valley fruit. A hint of leather is wrapped into tight, lightly smoky red fruit.

71,US,"Fascinating; this was co-fermented with 7% whole cluster Roussanne, then blended with another 4% Viognier. Inky, vivid, saturated and loaded with appealing scents of meat, smoke, cedar, pencil shavings, blackberry, black cherry and much more, this is Washington's answer to Barossa Shiraz.

75,Argentina,"Sweet and rooty on the nose, with hints of cola and earth. This is a solid red wine, with plum, berry and some mild astringency to the palate. Finishes a bit tart but still makes it to the quality level. Likely better with food than by itself.",85,18.0,Merlot,Felipe Rutini,Red,1.0,0.0
76,Spain,"A perennial Best Buy, Sangre de Toro always delivers a quality red-wine experience that does not bowl you over. Here the aromas are light and jammy, with strawberry.

93,US,"This little-sung (outside of Washington) winery makes an eagerly-awaited rosé of cabernet franc each spring, but here is the real deal. One hundred percent varietal, it puts the lie to the notion that cabernet franc must be tannic and tough.

95,US,"Young, fairly tough in tannins, and with a sappy, grapy taste, this is a wine that badly needs time in the bottle, as do most S&B; Pinots. It shows primary fruit flavors of cherries and blackberries, offset by crisp acidity despite full malolactic fermentation.

97,US,"So sweet and strong in jammy blackberry fruit, this young Cabernet is hardly drinkable now.

1487,US,"This perfectly captures this spectacular vineyard's flavor “stamp”—a beguiling mix of aromas, flavors and textures that begin with orange peel and moist earth and unfold across the palate in a graceful jumble. Streaks of compost, raw meat, tart berry and good funk run together seamlessly, creating a supple, continuously enjoyable wine that just doesn't want to quit.

1572,US,"Just shows you don't need a super high score to have a super drinkable wine with steak, pork, veal, chicken, or just a simple burger.

1576,Australia,"This is one spicy, sexy Shiraz. It tastes like a fruitstand exploded in the bottle—it shows vibrant, fresh plum and berry fruit in abundance, with caramel and oak in a supporting role. Try at once; one to drink now rather than save for later.",89,20.0,Shiraz,Serafino,Red,1.0,0.0
1577,US,"There's some green bitterness in this Bordeaux-style blend that suggests incompletely ripe berries or stems. In its favor is dryness and elegant balance, with low alcohol and interesting flavors of cherries, tangerine zest, herbs and cedar.",87,45.0,Meritage,Casa Nuestra,Red,1.0,0.0

1582,Australia,"This luxury release from Heathcote has been a steady performer over the years, and the 2007 boasts the same plush, velvety texture that prior vintages have shown.

1583,US,"Compared this to the winery's Cabernet Sauvignon, it's softer, richer and more accessible despite the big tannins that will enable the wine to age.

Drink now through 2014.",92,70.0,Red Blend,Von Strasser,Red,1.0,0.0
1584,US,"You don't want to drink this wine now. It's way too tannic, which also accentuates the acidity.

1585,US,"From a superb year, this wine saw all French oak, but an ongoing reduction in exposure to new barrels brought the percentage down to 60%.

1590,Bulgaria,"Oak plays a large role in this wine, with plenty of vanilla flavor and aroma intermixed with hung meat and pepper spice.

1592,France,"A rounded, mouthfilling wine. At the beginning, it seems very soft, but then it is possible to discern rich tannins through the concentrated red fruits and black plums.

1598,US,"Fruit and spice star in this bone-dry Cabernet. It's very forward in blackberries, cherries, currants and dark chocolate, while the spice shows in the form of pepper, clove and star anise.

1599,France,"Opulent yet so elegant, this wine has already achieved great balance. It comes from the soft richness of the generous fruit, the spice from both the wood and the fruit, and the roundness of the texture, which envelops you in its warmth and ripeness.

1603,France,"From the ripe, open 1995 vintage, this is a round wine with flavors of lemons, grapefruits and almonds. The angles of acidity have been turned into curves as it develops and softens.

1613,US,"While redolent of jasmine blossoms and sweet orange marmalade, Hosmer's dry Riesling is surprisingly austere on the palate with hints of fresh fennel fronds and a gripping lemon acidity.

2877,France,"There is enticing new wood here, a wine that shows richness to boost the ripe, creamy apple and pear fruits. It has a generous character, to contrast with its core of steely acidity.

2878,US,"This makes you wonder why it took so long for California vintners to understand that Chard doesn't have to be drenched in oak to be succulent.

2901,US,"From a dependable producer and a fine vintage comes a problematic wine. The fruit is nicely ripe and suggestive of apples and peaches, and it's balanced and dry. Acidity is adequate.

3060,Chile,"Heavily toasted, but with minerality the nose works. The palate starts with forward woodiness, but soon thereafter apple and green banana flavors push the oak aside.

You be the judge.",89,23.0,Chardonnay,Maycas del Limari,White,0.0,1.0
3061,Spain,"Fairly pungent, with apple and lemon aromas that are typical for the variety. The palate has an edge to it and jacked-up acidity that pushes citrus and pineapple flavors toward tangy.

3065,US,"Gary Farrell is one of the few wineries to obtain fruit from this coveted vineyard. As always, the wine is intensely concentrated in tropical fruits, green apples and pears, with such weight that it can easily handle lavish new French oak.

3156,US,"Marked by a lean minerality, this Chablis-style wine is not one of those fat, opulent Chards that dazzles with sheer richness. It's more subtle than that, and more acidic. Structure, in fact, is the name of the game here, with its lemon and lime flavors that barely break into green apples. Fine now, if not served too cold, and for the next 2–4 years. Beyond that, wines of this kind go quickly downhill.",92,65.0,Chardonnay,Morgan,White,0.0,1.0
3157,France,"A crisp, fresh and creamy wine, it has grapefruit acidity and a firm sense of mineral structure. The wine is developing well, but to bring out its balance between fruit and texture, it needs until 2015 in bottle.",89,26.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Vignobles Berthier,White,0.0,1.0
3158,New Zealand,"Fresh and appealing, but definitely on the green side of the Sauvignon Blanc spectrum. This medium-bodied wine features pungent sweaty and grassy aromas, as well as leafy, green-tomato flavors. Drink now.",87,10.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Clifford Bay,White,0.0,1.0
3159,France,"The flint soil of the vineyard shows in the steely, mineral character of this wine. It is all about structure at this stage, subduing the citrus fruits that are developing.

3160,Argentina,"What a score! Torrontès, a little-known Spanish white winegrape, turns out to be a superstar in Mendoza. Packed tight with bright, vivid, penetrating fruit, this strikingly flavorful wine begins with lovely scents of citrus, orange peel and tangerine and takes off from there. It moves into still more complexity, with traces of diesel, talc and flower petal. Think Viognier, Gewürztraminer and Riesling, blended and punched up with a full-bodied, lingering finish.",90,7.0,Torrontés,Bodega Lurton,White,0.0,1.0
3161,Australia,"Tumbarumba is an up-and-coming cool-climate viticulture region, and this Chardonnay is a fine example of why the area is considered to have promise.

3163,France,"The wood is too much for the fruit with this wine. At this stage in its development, there is a bitter, high toast character that dominates the white fruits.

3164,US,"Shows the bright acidity of Carneros, which seems even brighter this cool vintage.

3165,Chile,"Santa Helena has moved to the Colchagua Coast for its SB, and the results are impressive.

3169,Germany,"Wisps of smoke and crushed rock imbue this dry, broadly textured wine. Lemon and lime acidity strike the midpalate like a laser before melting into the mineral-rich sheen that extends the finish.

3171,US,"This is quite a hefty young Chard. It takes the basic elements of ripe, potent fruit, oak, and Burgundian-inspired technique and elevates it all, a Chard on steroids.

3177,US,"Rich and showy, but a little too strong in everything, showing flamboyant tropical fruit, caramelized oak, butterscotch and sweet vanilla cream flavors.

3183,New Zealand,"For fans of extreme pungency only. There's some grapefruit, but also large amounts of asparagus and hints of cat pee. Finishes tart, but not terribly fresh—after all, it is a 2002.

3190,US,"Right out of the glass, this wine broadcasts classic Viognier scents of citrus blossom, citrus rind and, well, citrus fruit.

3192,US,"Made without oak, one of the rare Carneros Chards that hasn't seen wood, this wine also never underwent malolactic fermentation. That means what you get is pure Carneros fruit and acidity.

3193,Argentina,"Floral and tropical aromas are a direct reflection of the 75% Torrontés in the blend. There's also lychee, another Torrontés byproduct.

3206,France,"Despite the slightly dark rosé color, this is a more mineral rendition of Tavel, with crushed stone and lime aromas. Yet it's also nicely rounded in the midpalate and long on the finish.

3207,Spain,"Good for the style, which is sweet and lightly bubbly. Smells melony, then feels fresh and lively in the mouth.

3210,France,"The wine is crisp, bright with acidity and red-currant fruits. It has weight while also having an intensely crisp texture.

3409,US,"Picturesque with a crystalline salmon color, it begins with the scent of just-bitten nectarine. The following flavors of tart apple and a slightly bitter salinity ensure the uniqueness of this wine. Mourvèdre (57%) is in the lead, followed closely by Grenache (28%) and Counoise (15%), all coming from the original cuttings of the Château de Beaucastel.

3453,US,"Zaca Mesa accomplishes the difficult task of creating a ripe, fruity rosé that finishes thoroughly dry. This is a minor miracle in California.

3853,Spain,"This is a perfectly good rosé that's 90% Tempranillo and 10% Viura, hence the Clarete name.

3854,US,"Would you believe Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay and French Columbard in a dry rose wine?

3861,US,"An amber-peach color and slight cloudiness signal that this dry wine is atypical. Its aromas are buttery and earthy, its flavors are savory and substantial (think melon and prosciutto), and the texture is unusually creamy, giving it a long, lingering finish.

3872,France,"Bottled in the Fabre family's specially designed Gallé bottle, this wine is a classic. It has fine ripe, but crisp, fruit and delicious balanced acidity.

3887,France,"This blend of 60% Syrah, 30% Grenache and 10% Cinsault is just a bit too confected. Bubble gum, melon and stone-fruit notes are bold and forward, then finish tart and dry.",85,12.0,Rosé,Château Beaubois,Rose,3.0,1.0

3890,US,"A full-bodied blend of 66% Mourvèdre, 30% Grenache and 4% Syrah bled off like a rosé and then fermented like a white wine, very reminiscent of a rosé from Provence.

3900,US,"Nice spice and strawberry fruit. The blend is a mish-mash—half Merlot, the rest Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Cab Franc, Viognier and Malbec.

4146,France,The Gasquet-Pascaud family has produced a light wine from its estate above Saint-Tropez. There is a yeasty character that gives it a richer more structured side. That should blow over as the wine ages for a few months just to bring out the fruitiness. Drink from late 2017.,88,20.0,Rosé,Les Maîtres Vignerons de la Presqu'île de Saint-Tropez,Rose,3.0,1.0
4147,France,"Reuilly has the peculiarity of having rosés from Pinot Gris, even though its reds are from Pinot Noir.

Drink now.",85,20.0,Rosé,Domaine Dyckerhoff,Rose,3.0,1.0
4148,Italy,"This is a bright pink rosé with a full bouquet of berry and floral aromas but also a pungent point of chemical or solvent at the back that creates an awkward first impression. The wine is bright, firm and crisp on the palate.",82,11.0,Rosé,Li Veli,Rose,3.0,1.0

4150,Canada,"This is just the second vintage for this winery, whose inviting labels look like handwritten notes.

4153,US,"This blush wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot. As you'd expect, it's a big wine for a rosé, a little heavy, but there's a nice cut of acidity that helps. Is it dry?

4155,Spain,"Fizzy and foamy and aggressive. To give it a frame of reference, it is similar to Brachetto or Frascati from Italy, but it's clumsy on the palate and tastes too much like red licorice and candied fruit to be taken too seriously.

4157,France,"The price is almost ridiculous for the quality.

4533,France,"This wine is from Alain Dominique Perrin's Lagrézette estate in Cahors, although it is not labeled as such because the Cahors AOP is only red wine.

4624,France,"In Provence, heavy bottle seems to equal high alcohol. It's true here, with a wine that, while it has the right pale grey pink color, is almost too rich for its own good.

4680,Italy,"The brilliant garnet-pink color of this wine makes a great first impression but the wine loses a few points on the nose where Camembert cheese or Parmigiano-like aromas are a distraction.

4690,France,"With some extra weight, this is a solid, red currant and berry driven wine. Its fruit is right up front, backed by a mineral acidity that cuts through the richness.

Thankfully, at least from the 2005 vintage, quality is high and prices reasonable. There are several cuvées bottled and marketed in the U.S., but one of my favorite 2005s was Les Lauzeraie, which boasts lots of mineral and crushed stone aromas. It's quite fruit-driven and rich on the palate, full of cherries and watermelon, while the silky texture gives ita slight edge over some of the other cuvées.",90,13.0,Rosé,Les Vignerons de Tavel,Rose,3.0,1.0

4705,US,"A pale pink color introduces this wine, as do fairly weak aromas of bubble gum and freshly squeezed lime. This is one of three rosés made by Proulx, and they are all rather subtle in expression, this one delivering a bit of lime and decent amount of tannic grip to the palate.

4708,US,"Tempranlillo is not the most common base for California rosé, but this might change some minds. It veers into the orange spectrum of pink color, and smells like a grapefruit spritzer. On the palate, there's lemon bar, almond paste, and bubblegum, but any perceived sweetness is wiped away by brisk acidity and a slightly bitter quality too. The layers of flavor are impressive.",89,25.0,Rosé,ONX,Rose,3.0,1.0

4713,US,"About as pale in color as they come, this wine is not light on flavor. It has bright citrus and dried herb aromas and similarly assertive flavors, backed by crisp acidity.

4721,France,"The main estate wine from Roubine is a rich, ripe and fruity with a light edge of spice. It has a soft character, the result of the malolactic fermentation reducing the acidity.

4724,France,"A disappointing effort from a normally reliable producer, Château de Ségriès's Tavel is still pleasant enough, but it comes across as slightly heavy and confected while delivering bold cherry-berry fruit.",83,16.0,Rosé,Château de Ségriès,Rose,3.0,1.0

4727,Austria,"A touch of cranberry plays on the nose of this wine. The palate shows that same tart freshness, assisted by lemony notes and a slight spritz. An easy, uncomplicated and refreshing summer wine.",88,12.0,Rosé,Winzer Krems,Rose,3.0,1.0
4728,US,"Kudos to Jorian Hill for crafting a rosé that's truly dry. It's a sophisticated, elegant blush wine with subtle raspberry, herb, rose petal, spice and mineral flavors, finished with a wonderfully clean scour of acidity.

4732,Spain,"Chunky aromas of murky red-berry fruits, pie cherry and briny oak struggle to impress. This feels saucy and resiny, while briny, oaky, citric flavors finish scattered and hot. Overall, this woody rosado isn't shining.",83,27.0,Rosado,Bodegas Tobía,Rose,3.0,1.0
4733,US,"A lovely rosé, a bit on the sweet side, with luscious cherry and raspberry tea, cola and vanilla flavors, and crisp acidity for balance. Almost as full-bodied as a Pinot Noir, the wine is made from Tempranillo grapes.",85,12.0,Rosé,Martin & Weyrich,Rose,3.0,1.0
4734,France,"Made from 50% Grenache, 30% Cinsault and 20% Syrah, this is a vibrant, floral rosé, offering upfront aromas of iris, lavender and laurel that complement the raspberry and strawberry-hull core.

4738,US,"So pale that it's almost yellow in color, this Rhône-based, Provence-inspired blend of 73% Grenache, 22% Mourvèdre, and 5% Counoise from seven distinct vineyards throughout the Paso Robles region hits the nose with lime, rain on concrete, and a nuttiness of almond. On the palate, it's very soft, though a tad tart, with more citrus and minerality emerging on the finish.",89,20.0,Rosé,Tablas Creek,Rose,3.0,1.0
4739,France,"In an effort to persuade us that rosé is not just for the summer, this is a wine ostensibly for winter. In fact, name aside, it could be consumed this summer as well.

4743,US,"Kevin Riley packs eight varieties into this pink wine, but the major proportion of Syrah and Grenache lend it its deep hue and rose petal, red cherry and vanilla notes on the nose.

4747,France,"Named after a green oak (Eouve in the local Provencal language), this wine is brightly aromatic, with a caramel flavor and tight acidity.

4752,Spain,"This is the first Las Brisas rosado that's come to us, and it's good in a tangy, tropical sort of way.

4755,US,"The first of the highly anticipated '05s are starting to appear, and to judge from this wine, west side Paso Rhônes will be winners. The wine benefited from a cool vintage, allowing the Mourvèdre, Grenache and Counoise long hang time, yet avoiding overly ripe fruit.

4757,France,"Pale in color, this is a fruity rosé. It's packed with acidity that gives a tight, crisp feel as well as red cherry and red currant fruits. The acidity could benefit from a few months of calming, so wait until 2015.",86,32.0,Rosé,Domaine Vacheron,Rose,3.0,1.0
4758,France,"Obviously a wine to drink on February 14, this is brightly fruity and crisp while showing some good dense flavors. Red fruits push through the citrus and grapefruit acidity to give a full-bodied, ripe wine.",90,25.0,Rosé,Château les Valentines,Rose,3.0,1.0

4762,US,"So sweet on the nose with ripe honeydew and strawberries scents, it's surprising how elegant and dry this is on the palate.

4763,US,"A pickle-barrel aroma hits the nose first, before the notes of red berries, rose petals and bitter papaya seeds surface.

4766,France,"Light and fruity, the wine comes from the sandy soils of the Camargue Rhône-delta region, known for its rugged, indigenous horses.

4767,US,"A Rhônish blend, with Barbera and Zinfandel, it showcases three of Randall Grahm's signatures, namely, it's refreshingly dry, invigorating in acids, and minerally-herbal-subtle in flavor instead of the intensely ripe fruit that usually marks California.

4779,France,"This blend of Cinsault, Grenache and Syrah is attractively fruity. It has a crisp texture that gives it a bright character, red-currant fruitiness and intense refreshing acidity.

4783,US,"To call this rosé deep is an understatement. In color and body, it's almost a red wine.

4787,US,"Bursting with scents of watermelon sorbet on a warm summer day, this salmon-colored Grenache-Syrah-Mourvèdre pinkie hits the palate with peach and strawberry essence. It gives a brief impression of alcoholic heat before a buttery finish, in part due to the barrel fermentation. Unlike many rosés that are released right away, Oso Libre holds their richer style back for a while, allowing the layered flavors to properly integrate.",88,26.0,Rosé,Oso Libre,Rose,3.0,1.0

4793,Chile,"This rosé is made from Cabernet Franc grapes, and it's briny to an extreme, with vegetal aromas.

4818,France,"Round, ripe and lemony, it's more like a very good California sparkler than fine Champagne. Tasty, fruity and approachable, but missing the refinement and the texture that elevates the very top Champagnes.",88,50.0,Champagne Blend,Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4819,France,"This is a really good rendition of this extra-tart, austere style of Champagne. Citrus and steel are the prime components—don't look for tropical fruits, toast or buttered nuts in this baby. This is a terroir-driven wine; it tastes like the chalk it's grown in. Can you say oysters and caviar? How about triple crème cheeses, foie gras, etc.? Made for the richest food you care to throw at it.",92,60.0,Champagne Blend,Laurent-Perrier,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4820,France,"An impressive, full and ripe wine, with dryness and fruitiness balanced with more complex mineral and tang. Delicious and finely made.",90,27.0,Sparkling Blend,Langlois-Chateau,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4821,Italy,"Peach and smoke aromas open this dry bubbly, but these pretty notes are marred by a soapy element. It's fairly dry, with faintly peachy flavors, intense mineral and even slightly medicinal accents.",81,30.0,Champagne Blend,Monte Rossa,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4822,France,"This is the first vintage of a cuvée named, so the advertising has it, after a figure who is both romantic and modern. It is certainly a fine blend that shows ripe fruit, some layers of toast to go with some honey and fresh white fruits. It should age, but, as an apéritif wine, it's ready to drink now.",91,65.0,Champagne Blend,Jacquart,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4823,Spain,"Apple and lime aromas are basic and distant. This is light on the palate, while green melon, lime, apple and green-bean flavors finish grassy, leesy, tart and bitter.",82,10.0,Sparkling Blend,Tarantas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4824,US,"Mild kirsch and pink-grapefruit aromas open this medium-weight sparkler. The apple flavors and leesy accents have a softness on the palate that will give the wine mass appeal. The long finish has a fragrant, lingering sweet-tartness.",86,24.0,Champagne Blend,Hagafen,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4825,US,"Even if you don't like sweet sparkling wine, it will be hard to turn down another glass of this beauty. It's so clean and delicious, with a raspberry sorbet and vanilla richness. One of the best sweet bubblies out there, at a great price.",88,12.0,Sparkling Blend,Korbel,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

4827,South Africa,"A soft, dry sparkling rosé with modest aromas and flavors of strawberry hull, white cranberry and grapefruit peel. Medium bodied with assertive carbonation and a clean finish. So juicy and refreshing, this would be an excellent choice for brunch or lunch al fresco.",85,16.0,Champagne Blend,Graham Beck,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4828,Israel,"Fresh yet rich, this sparkler boasts great balance between the red-apple and orange fruit notes and the toasty, sweet spice accents.

4829,Spain,"A fine Cava with easygoing white fruit aromas and a cushioned, full and round palate. Tastes rich and honeyed, with toasty, nutty, dry apple and pear flavors. Elegant and complex, with texture and style.",91,50.0,Sparkling Blend,Juvé y Camps,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

4831,France,"This is a full-bodied and fruity wine. It has ripe red berry fruits as well as layers of warm citrus and fresh acidity. It's the richness that shows most strongly here, from the fruit to the texture, very much a house style of Ruinart. Drink now.",91,75.0,Champagne Blend,Ruinart,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4832,France,"Very dry in style, this is a beautifully crisp, tight and taut Champagne. It has citrus and green apple flavors, and is steely in character while also fruity. It could do well with some more bottle age.",92,70.0,Champagne Blend,H. Blin,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4833,US,"Made in a frankly sweet style, this blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay has jellied flavors of raspberries, cherries and toast. It's a little rough in texture.",85,24.0,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

4836,France,"A crisp, finely balanced wine, this is packed with fresh citrus, peach-skin and green-apple flavors. It's a textured wine with layers of minerality on the palate.

4840,France,"Hay, nutmeg and sourdough are aromatic partners to the toasty char and cheese flavors. Although a bit frothy, the flinty acidity and dry finish leave the palate clean and refreshed. This is young, mainstream and tasty.",87,25.0,Champagne Blend,Duval-Leroy,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4841,Spain,"An opening salvo of honey and white fruits is solid as can be. The palate rolls out dry, angular citrus, pineapple and apple flavors in front of a finish that's naturally fresh and nutty. A bubbly with no muss, fuss or confusion. Best if you like ‘em dry.",89,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Cava Blancher,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4842,France,"A ripe, creamy, toasty wine which has some mature oxidation that enhances the wine. Shows that Jura's sparkling wines have the ability to age. But do enjoy it this year—it won't age further.",89,24.0,Sparkling Blend,Andre et Mireille Tissot,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4843,US,"This has the pretty color of pink copper, a delicately yeasty aroma; and rich, sweet flavors of strawberry, lime and toast. It's a little scouring on the palate. The blend is nearly equal parts Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.",88,27.0,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4844,US,"Made from 90% Chardonnay and 10% Pinot Gris, this lovely Blanc de Blancs brims with vanilla cream, lime and pear aromas and flavors, with the yeasty, baked bread dough toastiness that mark the best sparkling wines.

4845,France,"I applaud the fact that Paillard clearly labels his wines with the date of disgorgement—this one was August 2005. The wine immediately offers up enticing scents of peaches, apricots and cherries. It's a full, fruit-powered Champagne that's round and rich and unusually ripe. It delivers a lot of flavor up front, and holds there through a clean finish.",90,56.0,Champagne Blend,Bruno Paillard,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4846,France,"An attractively fresh wine, with white flower aromas, packed with delicate acidity and white fruits. Crisp fruits hide a touch of softness that allows the wine to finish balanced and light.",85,14.0,Champagne Blend,Les Caves de Bailly,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

4848,US,"Made mostly from Chardonnay, with a touch of Pinot Noir, this is so rich and creamy, it's like satin gliding across the mouth, carrying waves of lemon- and lime-infused buttercream, brioche and a smoky flavor. It feels classy and delicious from the first sniff to the seemingly sweet finish.",93,45.0,Sparkling Blend,Chandon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

4850,France,"This is yeasty, bearing crisp flavors of pear and green apple, with a taut lemon-zest texture and a firm edge of minerality. It needs at least three years in bottle.",90,24.0,Champagne Blend,Bailly-Lapierre,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4851,Spain,"Lollipop aromas are muddled and not very convincing, while the palate is unfocused and borders on sour. Foamy and abrasive on the cheeks, with a mediocre flavor profile. From the outside this looks great (nice bottle and label) but the insides are shaky.",82,29.0,Sparkling Blend,Roger Goulart,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4852,France,"This nonvintage is sweeter and softer than some of the other Champagnes in the Vollereaux range. The result is a wine that is ready to drink, full of fresh apple acidity with an attractive kiwi aftertaste.",87,35.0,Champagne Blend,Vollereaux,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4853,France,"A great Champagne, rich and full-bodied, with a fine mineral streak and almost of austerity that demands aging. It is tight on the structure, yet ripe on the mature fruit, which is changing into its secondary toast, walnut and quince. It could still age over five years or more.",93,95.0,Champagne Blend,Henriot,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4854,France,"A sweet, soft rosé, with strawberry flavors, light acidity and a full-bodied feel. The finish is relatively sweet.",86,60.0,Champagne Blend,Forget-Brimont,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4855,Spain,"Nice and fresh, with defined, attractive apple and pear aromas. Dry and fruity in the mouth, with a tad of sweetness to the firm papaya, lime and apple flavors.

4857,US,"The first duty of a blush bubbly is to be delicious and elegant, and this one is, despite the full-bodied flavors from a majority of Pinot Noir. The wine is dry and complex, with flavors of raspberries, cherries, limes, buttery vanilla, yeast and smoky oak. Really good, and will develop through 2013.",93,42.0,Sparkling Blend,Gloria Ferrer,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4858,France,"With its beautiful pale pink color and bright fruitiness, this delicious wine also has a good depth of texture, mineral strength and tight acidity.

4860,US,"Domaine Carneros's finest Blanc de Blancs blend, it is made entirely from estate-grown fruit. This 2007 is distinguished by complex layers of pear compote and ginger spice—round, soft and still well-toned in acidity. As it ages expect more of the almond-hazelnut undertones to take center stage, a delightful accompaniment to fruit desserts, creamy French cheeses or salty shellfish.",91,99.0,Sparkling Blend,Domaine Carneros,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4861,France,"A nice straw/pale yellow color, the nose on this wine is subdued, with hints of grain, lime and slate, but the palate perks up with plenty of citrus flavor leaning toward lime. Balanced, with a smooth feel and tiny bubbles, this delicious sparkler will instigate caviar dreams.",90,18.0,Sparkling Blend,Léonce Bocquet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4862,France,"Tense and crisp, this is a balanced food-friendly Champagne. It is dry, and its apple- and citrus-like acidity has rounded out with some bottle age. The acidity cuts right through to give the wine a great lift of freshness on the finish.",90,47.0,Champagne Blend,Gosset,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4863,France,"A perfect salmon shade, with scents of peaches, cherries and toast. It hits the palate with big, ripe, fresh fruit: crisp apples, peaches, cherries and citrus. Concentrated and full, with a tart, fresh back end that lingers into a cherry-vanilla finish.",90,52.0,Champagne Blend,Gosset,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4864,Spain,"Quite hard on the nose, with classic petrol aromas that almost smell of rubber cement. Tough and tight on the palate; it takes some effort to penetrate. Once inside there's crisp apple and lime zest. A true “nature” in every sense.",87,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Juvé y Camps,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4865,US,"Crisp and clean, this is a very nice sparkling wine for everyday purposes at an everyday price. It's just a little sweet, with vanilla cream, peach sorbet and citrus fruit vibrancy. Pinot Noir and Chardonnay are among the constituent grapes, along with Chenin Blanc and French Colombard.",86,12.0,Sparkling Blend,Korbel,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4866,France,"A rich wine that parades great citrus and pear juice fruits to go with its intense texture of green apple skins and vivid acidity. It tastes very fresh, veering towards dry and could benefit from several months' bottle age. A step up in quality for this producer.",88,48.0,Champagne Blend,J. Dumangin Fils,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4867,US,"A little sweet and rough around the edges, with the flavors of raspberry and cherry brioche. The blend is 60% Chardonnay and 40% Pinot Noir, and this is Schramsberg's second label.",84,23.0,Sparkling Blend,Mirabelle,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4868,US,"A complex and complete wine with everything in place, this tastes delicious from the first whiff to the lingering finish.

4869,US,"Made primarily from Pinot Noir with a little Chardonnay, this has a subtle color of the first blush on a peach, and is fragrant and delicious. The fruit flavors of raspberries and cherries have a lime tinge, and the finish is dry and impressively long. Really easy to like, just filled with charm and finesse.",92,42.0,Sparkling Blend,Gloria Ferrer,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4870,France,"Mature, with a touch of scrambled egg and burnt sulfur on the dry bouquet. This one runs lean and crisp, with green apple and a hint of lemon on the palate. That said, there's still laudable depth of flavor and complexity. Overall the impression is largely of citrus. Imported by Laurent-Perrier.",90,90.0,Champagne Blend,Laurent-Perrier,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4871,Spain,"Always one of Spain's best bubblies, this is precise and dry, with a dusty apple aroma and only a bit of yeast on the bouquet. It feels expansive and rich, with cutting acidity that's offset by yeasty cream, toast and butterscotch flavors. Juicy and generous at the same time.",92,116.0,Sparkling Blend,Agustí Torelló,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4872,Italy,"Creamy and toasty in the mouth, with nice acidity to give it structure. A consistent sparkler with enough versatility to be consumed with a meal; not just for toasting. Imported by Prestige Wine Imports Corp.",89,13.0,Sparkling Blend,Rotari,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4873,Spain,"Standard as good brut Cavas go, with yeast, citrus and a hint of matchstick on the nose. The palate shows a good fabric comprised of lemon-lime and apple flavors. Good up front but a little weak on the back end and finish. Still, as a whole this is perfectly good, affordable bubbly that does what it's supposed to do.",87,12.0,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4874,France,"This is a bright style of Champagne that's fresh and crisp. It has a strong citrus tang, with notes of green apple and attractive lemon zest. It is fit for an apéritif.",89,45.0,Champagne Blend,Piper-Heidsieck,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4875,US,"This has picked up softness and a honeyed mouthfeel, as the chemistry of aging on the lees does its magic. The wine has a plush, creamy feeling, with the silky smoothness of a great sparkling wine. Flavorwise, it's all pears, limes, dough and cinnamon spice. Delicious now, and should hold and improve over the next eight years.",93,100.0,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4876,US,"Deeply colored for a rosé sparkling wine, and full bodied, with raspberry and cherry jam, vanilla wafer and yeasty, baked dough flavors. Slightly sweet, too. Champagne fans won't like it, but millions of ordinary consumers will.",85,10.0,Sparkling Blend,Ballatore,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4877,US,"The orange, vanilla and cream flavors are tasty, but the texture is scoury and harsh in the mouth, with rough bubbles that cut with acidity.",83,30.0,Sparkling Blend,Pope Valley Winery,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4878,France,"One of the few houses still to ferment in wood (Krug is another), Alfred Gratien cultivates an intense style of wine, which has toasty, buttery characters as well as richness. From 1997, this wine is lighter than other Alfred Gratien vintages, showing more acidity than richness, but there is still a stylistic similarity there.",93,95.0,Champagne Blend,Alfred Gratien,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4879,France,"This is a full-bodied wine, with the Pinot fruit showing strongly in the blend, producing richness and a sweet-tasting character. This most recent cuvée from Roland Champion is powerful—a fine combination of minerality and bottle age. Keep it for 3–4 years, but it can be consumed now.",88,50.0,Champagne Blend,Roland Champion,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4880,France,"With its searing crisp character, this is a wine for food. Very textured, apple skins cut through the citrus acidity, creating a taut, nervy wine, although finishing with a richer, more yeasty character.",90,55.0,Champagne Blend,Philipponnat,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4881,Spain,"Very strange from the start. Odd stuff, with a candied, spice-like set of aromas that go straight to sweet, dull gumdrop flavors. Feels o.k. on the palate but tastes and smells weird.",82,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Font I Jordana,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4882,US,"This is the winery's highest quality wine, named in honor of their late winemaker, Guy Devaux, who brought a Champagne sensibility to the brand. At the age of eight years, it's softly complex and delicious in lime, raspberry, yeasty brioche and vanilla flavors. It has that hard to define quality of finesse that makes a fine sparkling wine so special.",93,65.0,Sparkling Blend,Mumm Napa,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4883,US,"True to its name, the wine is crimson in color, and sweet, with honeyed raspberry, cherry and vanilla flavors. Easy to drink due to the balanced sweetness.",84,8.0,Sparkling Blend,Ballatore,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4884,US,"This wine is a little scoury in the mouthfeel, with big bubbles that give it some roughness, but otherwise it is a fine brut. Among the driest of the winery's new releases, it shows citrus, tropical fruit and yeast flavors, with firm acid.",90,50.0,Sparkling Blend,Iron Horse,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4885,France,"A powerful wine that is very ripe and soft. What makes it work so well is the toast, the acidity from a high proportion of Pinot Noir, and the dense, full structure. This is, without question, a food wine. It should also age over 4–5 years at least.",93,100.0,Champagne Blend,Philipponnat,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4886,France,"This is a top-of-the-range crémant that is crisp and textured while also fruity. It has richness, laced with acidity and citrus. Fresh and full of apple flavor, it's an impressive wine that could age a year or two in bottle.",90,25.0,Sparkling Blend,JCB,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4887,Spain,"A little aggressive out of the chute, with a nose that's sort of raspy. The fruit on the palate is tangy and tastes like early picked nectarines with a lemon twist. Crisp and short, but very clean and focused.",86,12.0,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4888,US,"The best of Korbel's sparkling wines, and one that can stand next to bubblies that cost two or three times as much. Rich and dry, it has a very creamy mouthfeel, with subtle, complex flavors of lime, grapefruit, strawberry and yeast. It's a brut-style wine made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.",91,16.0,Sparkling Blend,Korbel,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

4890,France,"Diamant Bleu used to be a brand name of Heidsieck Monopole, now transferred to the Vranken range when Vranken acquired Heidsieck. It's a rather hard wine, with edges of acidity and showing sharp grapefruit flavors.",86,125.0,Champagne Blend,Vranken,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4891,Spain,"Timid but clean as a whistle on the nose, with apple and vanilla aromas along with a sprinkling of talcum powder. The palate is lively and fresh, with flavors of pineapple, lemon and other tropical hints. Entirely pedestrian as cava goes, but 100% clean and refreshing.",87,11.0,Sparkling Blend,Cavas Hill,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4892,France,"Very fine bubbles, with a firm, precise entry that is stylish to the hilt. This is a confident, assertive style, tart but not thin, with fennel and lemon-oil streaks running through the green fruit. It holds together nicely on the mid-palate, like a rock in the midst of a freshwater mountain stream. Young and crisp, it sails into a long and complex finish that promises rewards with a bit of further cellaring.",91,44.0,Champagne Blend,Delamotte,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4893,France,"The lightest pink in color, this delicacy translates into the pure Chardonnay of the Champagne itself which has Pinot Noir added to give color and just a touch of red-fruit flavors.",88,60.0,Champagne Blend,Agrapart & Fils,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4894,Spain,"A bulky, fruity style of cava that begins with aromas of floor polish, fruit essence and roasted corn. Shows much more citrus in the mouth, where the flavors run toward orange juice, lime and tarragon. Crisp and apple-based late, but never exciting enough to stir fandom.",86,16.0,Sparkling Blend,Mont Marçal,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4895,US,"This is a classy bottle of bubbly from the light copper color to the lightly fruity, yeasty aromas to the crisp mouthfeel and satisfying spice and raspberry flavors. A sense of layered richness is balanced by good acidity for balance.",91,23.0,Sparkling Blend,Scharffenberger,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4896,Spain,"Not overly fruity up front; instead there's a strong hint of lettuce, greens and peach pit on the bouquet. The palate is more round and giving, with a tropical blend of pineapple, citrus and apple flavors. Finishes dry and firm, making it perfectly good in the $12-and-under category.",87,12.0,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4897,US,"What an easy-to-drink, delicious bubbly this is. With a golden salmon color, it's rich in flavors of strawberry, raspberry, lime, vanilla and yeast. It finishes with a subtle sweetness. Pair it with sushi, sashimi or ham-based dishes.",89,24.0,Sparkling Blend,Mumm Napa,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4898,France,"This is a full-flavored, round and spicy ready-to-go bottle of bubbly. The LeRoy Neiman graphics and cava-style bottle suggest party time, and the flavors are right up against banana-ish tropicality. But the ripeness is nicely cut with leesy acids, and the wine manages not to fall off a cliff; rather it extends itself with layers of stone and mineral.",91,35.0,Champagne Blend,Duval-Leroy,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4899,Spain,"Light aromas of petrol and lemon-lime are entirely correct for cava, and the palate pushes fresh fruit in the tangerine and grapefruit realm. Has a bit of heft and zap, with a dry, largely clean finish. Fine on its own; maybe better in a Spanish-style mimosa. Imported by CIV/USA.",85,9.0,Sparkling Blend,Cristalino,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4900,France,"A cuvée of 100% grands crus vineyards. Massive, effusive bubbles explode in the glass, and the nose rises up with rich toast and brioche. Far more weight and concentration than the excellent “La Francaise.”  Prélude wows you with fresh pastry, marzipan and lemon meringue set against grapefruity acids. Young, luscious and built to last.",93,70.0,Champagne Blend,Taittinger,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4901,France,"At first, the bouquet reads like bread dusted with powdered sugar; after a few minutes in the glass, the nose takes on burnt-sugar and caramel notes.  in the mouth, it's soft, effervescent and on the sweet side: Flavors of white peach, chalk (and that powdered-sugar note again) are most prominent.  Finishes short to medium, with sugar and a citrus tang.  It's not terribly complex, but it will have wide appeal; there's not much tang or tautness, and will go down easy.",84,27.0,Champagne Blend,Heidsieck & Co Monopole,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4902,Moldova,"A sweet, heady nose of citrus and minerals leads on this pretty but simple sparkler. Robust flavors of toast and minerals offer roundness, character and a food-friendly slant, but the wine needs some complexity.",82,23.0,Sparkling Blend,Acorex,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

4904,Australia,"A carbonated pink blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this is a sweet, fruity wine that packs more punch than Bracchetto d'Acqui but is otherwise similar. It's very fragrant and loaded with strawberries and raspberries.",84,13.0,Sparkling Blend,R Wines,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4905,US,"This is Korbel's Chardonnay-based sparkling wine, and it showcases the house style of clean acidity, slight sweetness and scouring bubbles. The Chardonnay shines through in its typical notes of lime and kiwi fruit.",87,13.0,Sparkling Blend,Korbel,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

4908,Spain,"Red in color, with a reedy, cinnamon nose that speaks to the 60% Pinot Noir in the wine. Flavors of strawberry and raspberry are downgraded by a rhubarb quality, and the mouthfell clamps down like a vise. Fruity but not dry or balanced enough to impress.",82,10.0,Sparkling Blend,Cristalino,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4909,US,"Frankly sweet, and zesty in acidity, this is a nice, clean bubbly for those who like a bit of sugar in the finish. It has pleasant flavors of tangerine and vanilla, with a light, delicate mouthfeel.",85,9.0,Sparkling Blend,Ballatore,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4910,US,The rosé is especially nice; with a pretty cherry core of sweet fruit. Basically it is free run (saignée) juice with a smidgen (two percent of  still wine added to brighten the color. Barrel aged and fermented; 300 cases produced.,88,24.0,Sparkling Blend,Mountain Dome,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4911,US,"With a touch of sweetness, this brut is made from about 75% Chardonnay and 25% Pinot Noir. It's rich in strawberry, lime, orange and raspberry flavors, with a savory yeastiness.

4914,Spain,"A lively number with kick and effervescence. The nose is kind, with light fruits and a whiff of chocolate.

4915,Argentina,"Aggressive lemon-lime aromas are itchy, and the nose turns grassy and green. Overactive in the mouth, and tough to hold on the palate. Just at the level of acceptable; warning signs have been posted.",80,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Reginato,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4916,Italy,"Packaged in an elegant bottle with a squarish-squat shape, this pretty Rosé sparkler opens with aromas of Granny Smith apple, citrus and a touch of sweet peach.

4918,Chile,"Undurraga has never been know for sparkling wines, and this brut isn't going to help much. It smells okay, with applesauce and lemon-lime stirring intrigue. But the palate and feel are off. It's foamy in the mouth, with undefined white-fruit flavors. Not ready for prime time.",81,12.0,Champagne Blend,Undurraga,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4919,US,"Released after five years on the yeast, this is still a young, tartly aggressive bubbly. It is in fact by far the most acidic of Iron Horse's current stable of superb bubblies. But it's enormously rich, offering a wealth of subtle lime, peach, strawberry, toast and sourdough bread flavors that impress with both depth and length, as well as sheer class. Wonderful now, and should age effortlessly for six to eight years.",93,37.0,Sparkling Blend,Iron Horse,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4920,France,"With its distinctive flower bottle, this is an immediately recognizable Champagne, both in its looks and its distinctive Perrier-Jouët elegance.

4922,US,"Made entirely from Chardonnay, this is the most elegant and delicate of the winery's current bubblies. It's a dry, sophisticated wine, with subtle citrus, peach, apple and yeast flavors.

4923,US,"Starts out with aromas of toast, strawberries and citrus. Tart and dry and very fresh; this should hold well in the bottle for some time.

4930,Spain,"Dusty, yeasty aromas of red apple skins, cherry and chocolate lead to a solid and true palate with a good bubble bead, moderate elegance and full flavors of plum, red apple, cherry and spice. This is full-bodied Cava with a smooth, robust finish.",88,24.0,Sparkling Blend,Llopart,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4931,Spain,"This smooth, stylish wine is on the way up, as evidenced by the two-point bump it's receiving from its last review, in December 2004. Today it's round and full, with aromas of hay and popcorn that draw you in. Layered through the middle, with expressive white fruit, dryness and sweetness all in one. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",90,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Marques de Monistrol,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

4934,US,"Lots to like in this lovely sparkling wine, aged on the yeast for many years before being released.

Elegant and upscale, it's at its best now, so drink up.",93,45.0,Sparkling Blend,Gloria Ferrer,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4935,France,"A taut, mineral wine with a domiNAce of Chardonnay to give the crispest citrus and a very textured feel.

4936,US,"The blend this vintage was 68% Pinot Noir and 32% Chardonnay. The wine is a bit softer than some of Iron Horse's other bubblies, and less woody, with a higher dosage that adds a touch of honey to the lime zest and yeast.

4937,France,"Aggressively toasty, with a slightly burnt edge to the aromas, which also include green apple, lime and fern fronds. Seems a bit sweet on the finish.",83,11.0,Sparkling Blend,Charles de Fère,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4938,France,"A soft and beautifully ripe Champagne, albeit with a steely, mineral core. It is very much in the Gosset pure, dry style, full of apple and grapefruit acidity to go with a light yeast character. Unlike some 2000s, this should age well.",93,90.0,Champagne Blend,Gosset,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4939,France,"This is soft, with ripe peach flavors and some toasty acidity. It's an easy style, perfumed and ready to drink.",88,120.0,Champagne Blend,Vranken,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4940,Italy,"A beautiful wine with a pale rose color that shines with golden and reddish highlights, just like the skin of a ripe peach.

4941,France,"Fairly deep in color for a sparkling rosé, Sparr's Brut Rosé offers bold, berry-like aromas with hints of spring flowers and a plump, slightly corpulent feel in the mouth. The flavors are a bit rustic, with hints of underbrush and scorched earth.",84,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Pierre Sparr,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4942,Spain,"Aromas of cherry and leather come with burnt earth and smoke, but overall the nose is inviting. The palate is solid in feel, with good weight and drive that supports a smoky flavor profile of red berries and controlled bitterness. Finishes toasty, with a lick of bitter chocolate.",87,18.0,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

4944,Spain,"Nice enough on the nose, but like soda in the mouth. Tastes lean and lemony on one take, then like apple cider on the next take. Loses steam as it goes; no lift to the finish.",81,12.0,Sparkling Blend,Gran Pasión,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

4947,France,"This is certainly rich, packed with youthful green- and white-fruit flavors, but it still has that seductive elegance that is the hallmark of Deutz.

4949,France,"Piper's style is toasty, soft and lively, and this chimes with the open character of the 1998 vintage.

4952,US,"With a pretty pink-salmon color, this Pinot Noir-based blush is rich and full-bodied.

Impossible not to fall in love with this raspberry-scented beauty, but why wouldn't you want to?",94,41.0,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4953,Spain,"Smooth and simple stuff. It's quite fresh and clean, with more citrus and cherry than what you'd get from a Catalonian Pinot Noir. And that's because this is made entirely from the Trepat grape, which results in a racy, zippy personality. A refreshing cava for fans of leaner, crisper styles.",86,18.0,Sparkling Blend,Castellroig,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4954,France,"A very soft wine, flavored with nutmeg and baked apples. It is unfocused, and the acidity seems to come in from a strange angle, leaving a wine that is easy to drink, but not quite together.",86,49.0,Champagne Blend,Mailly Grand Cru,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4955,Italy,"This fresh sparkling blend from Franciacorta in northern Italy opens with a touch of citrus zest followed by yellow rose and crushed white pepper. It offers a tonic, drying mouthfeel with steely effervescence on the finish.",88,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Cornaleto,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4956,Spain,"Even though it's a sweet-styled Cava, the nose kicks up lemon and apple aromas that are familiar as can be. The palate, however, is quite sweet and supports the Semi Dry labeling. Candied but not sticky, with a slightly chalky finish.",85,9.0,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4957,US,"This is a rather sweet bubbly made from indeterminate varieties the winery doesn't reveal. It's clean and zesty, with tropical fruit, green grape and vanilla flavors.",84,12.0,Sparkling Blend,Ca' Secco,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

4959,France,"A very pure, almost linear wine with plenty of fresh acidity. There is some structure of young tannins, but the main flavors are the gooseberries, kiwis and very green apples. A fine apéritif wine. Multiple U.S. importers.",88,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Bailly-Lapierre,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4960,US,"All of Korbel's new sparklers are good values—when are they not? But this rosé is particularly elegant and delicious. It's not just the strawberries, lemon zest, vanilla and yeasty dough flavors, which are tasty enough, it's the mouthfeel, which shows real Champagne finesse and silkiness. This blend of Russian River Pinot Noir and Sangiovese, Chenin Blanc and Gamay from the Sacramento Delta is addictively drinkable.",87,11.0,Sparkling Blend,Korbel,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4961,US,"Pretty dark in color and full bodied for a sparkling wine, even one that's majority Pinot Noir. But it's delicious and dry, which surely are prime requisites for any bubbly.

4962,Spain,"The nose begins with wheat grass and chopped chive before folding in peach, clover and honey.

4963,France,"Jacquart makes a full-bodied, ripe style of Champagne, with tiny, effusive bubbles. Flavors of slightly overripe apples lead into a mature palate with hints of oxidation. Sherry, nuts, olive oil, vanilla and other less identifiable nuances meld into a rich, ripe, satisfying and complex whole.",92,38.0,Champagne Blend,Jacquart,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4964,Italy,"This Brut Rosé opens with a very delicate raspberry color and light aromas of rose petal, cassis and small berries. Pair this refreshing sparkling wine with fried wontons in spicy sauce.",85,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Il Follo,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4965,Spain,"Among bone-dry Cavas, this is one of the best in Spain. It's focused pastry and pear aromas lead directly onto the tangy, citric palate.

4970,Italy,"Lightly scrambled egg, vanilla and apple fruit all total a seductive, classy nose that's one part Champagne and one part Italian. Crisp but deep, with lovely apple and peach flavors.

Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd.",93,59.0,Sparkling Blend,Bellavista,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4971,US,"The deep-gold color shows how long this wine has been aging. Smoky, toasted baguette aromas lead to very rich flavors that taste almost sweet but are appetizingly dry.

4972,US,"One of the winery's sweeter sparkling wines, this one's mostly Pinot Noir, which accounts for the full-bodied flavors of raspberries. One-quarter Chardonnay brings refreshing lime acidity.

4973,Spain,"For a consistently pleasing brut nature (no added sweetness), Juvé y Camps is one place to turn. This wine is dominated by match stick, apple, pear and light vanilla aromas, which are backed by meet-in-the-middle flavors of citrus, apple and celery.

4974,US,"Made mostly from Pinot Noir, with the balance Chardonnay, this is a richly satisfying sparkling wine.

4983,US,"Mainly Pinot Noir, with some Chardonnay for brightness and citrusy zest, this brilliantly clean wine has an incredibly fierce mousse.

Delicious and compelling now. Try with sushi.",94,38.0,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

4987,France,"As they begin to mature, it's good to be reminded of the 1996 vintage. The initial austerity is now blossoming into finely balanced wines, even though the acidity is always going to be a dominant factor. This wine is still young, in fact, still with its fresh fruits, only just showing some mineral and toast character. Age for 10 years or more.",94,50.0,Champagne Blend,Duval-Leroy,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4988,France,"Very dry, packed with grapefruit juice flavors. At the same time, this is a tense, serious wine, with a great mineral presence, touch of toast and the potential to age in bottle. It is best with food.",90,84.0,Champagne Blend,Lallier,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

4994,Spain,"More in the Champagne style, meaning the nose is yeasty and toasty, and the color is more gold than pale yellow.

4996,Spain,"Aromas of carpet cleaner and stems constitute a strange mix, while the palate shows good weight and zest along with flavors of candied white fruits and orange peel. Abundant sweetness thickens the finish, and overall it seems like a strange style for everyday consumption.",83,9.0,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4997,US,"The blend is Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. The wine remains tough, dry and scoury at the age of 11 years, showing its yeastiness and subtle flavors of Meyer lemons and limes. It's elegant, but probably not going anywhere, so drink up. Sushi will be an ideal companion.",90,70.0,Sparkling Blend,Gloria Ferrer,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4998,Australia,"This pale salmon rosé is a reliable sparkling wine at a very good price. The latest NV release is toasty on the nose, then offers just faint hints of peach or berry flavors. It's lithe yet creamy on the palate, with a long finish.",90,22.0,Sparkling Blend,Jansz,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
4999,France,"This is a beautifully balanced, elegant and mature sparkler. There is fruit—ripe strawberry—but the main character is its fine balance and richness. It can age, though it is at its best now.",94,222.0,Champagne Blend,Billecart-Salmon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5002,France,"A steely, mineral-driven Champagne, dry with signs of toasty bottle age. The wine is also crisp, layered with intense apples and citrus. The fruit and the more mature character are right in balance at this stage.",90,45.0,Champagne Blend,Beaumont des Crayères,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5003,Spain,"This is definitely a briny specimen, but under the pickled blanket there's depth of fruit, texture and complexity.

5005,Spain,"With some toast and popcorn to fatten up the standard apple aromas, this is a fairly rich cava, especially given the price.

Strides better than your average quaffer.",87,9.0,Sparkling Blend,Codorníu,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5008,Spain,"Lime, apple and mineral aromas come with a note of eggy yeast. The mouthfeel is regular and a touch foamy, with semisweet flavors of kiwi, apple and gooseberry. Mild and feeling good on the finish, it's basic but well worth a go.",87,19.0,Sparkling Blend,V&N; Cellars,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5012,US,"Assembled from dozens of individual lots, this sumptuous brut is an example of the art of blending.

5022,France,"This is a seriously dry wine. Arnaud Margaine works each harvest to create freshness and a totally crisp texture, generally dismissing malolactic fermentation. It is balanced, allowing the fruitiness to shine through the tight, mineral texture from the predominant Chardonnay in the blend that comes from a mere 16-acre Montaigne de Reims vineyard surrounded by Pinot Noir. It could age through 2015 in bottle to be even better.",91,55.0,Champagne Blend,A. Margaine,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5034,France,"A classic Champagne blend of Chard and Pinot Noir gives this wine some good depth and ripe flavors. Has flavors of toast, spices and pears as well as some good tannin structure.

5035,Argentina,"A little sweet on the nose, but also fairly scattered and unfocused. The feel is nice and the bubble bead is right on.

5036,Italy,"Gold in color, with aromas of wheat bread and Golden Delicious apples. Lots of fresh peach, apple and tangerine on the palate make for a pleasing flavor profile, while it finishes full and toasty. Nothing overwhelming, but rock solid as a whole. Imported by Prestige Wine Imports Corp.",87,11.0,Sparkling Blend,Rotari,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5037,France,"In this crisp, fresh, very dry rosé Champagne, the red fruits are laced with acidity and apple. A touch of bitterness suggests the wine needs to age a few months in bottle, to soften and get a more generous feel.",87,59.0,Champagne Blend,Tendil & Lombardi,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5038,France,"This top wine from Pannier is beautifully crafted and balanced, a credit to the cooperative. It has intense flavors of grapefruit, livened with lemon zest and fresh, crisp acidity.

5041,Spain,"Ginger ale and a touch of powdered sugar give this extra dry Cava its proper sweet aromas. The flavors are solid, if you like candied orange slices and lemon-lime soda.

5042,US,"Bright yellow with fresh lime aromas and flavors of yellow fruit and pear. A bubbly, broad wine that lacks the substance of some of Gruets other bottlings.",83,13.0,Sparkling Blend,Gruet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5043,Spain,"Floral melon and peach aromas are mellow. This feels round, with citrusy acidity cutting into the body. Basic grapefruit and apricot flavors are friendly, while this is a touch foamy on the finish.",89,18.0,Sparkling Blend,Vilarnau,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5044,Spain,"The nose on this brut is a touch grassy, with apple aromas. On first take, it feels foamy, but with time it settles down.

5047,Spain,"Focused crisp aromas of white fruits reflect a cool vintage. This is roughly one-quarter each Macabeo, Parellada, Xarello and Chardonnay, and it feels tight, fresh and focused. Dry stone-fruit flavors include a hint of lime, while this is clean on the finish.",90,25.0,Sparkling Blend,Albet I Noya,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5048,Spain,"Light, elegant and hinting at lemon-lime on the bouquet. The mouth is mellow, complete and not the least bit aggressive, with peach and melon flavors that turn drier and mildly pithy on the finish. Well-executed and elegant cava, but simple in its totality because it's brut nature.",89,29.0,Sparkling Blend,Llopart,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5049,France,"This excellent producer makes a lovely, copper-colored rosé, which sends up fresh and inviting aromas that suggest fresh-baked apple pastries. Baking spices, cinnamon in particular, liven up the scents and flavors, and the wine seems crisp, balanced and full in the mouth.

5050,US,"Delicate sprays of cherry blossom and raspberry waft from nose to finish on this salmon-pink blend of traditional Champagne grape varieties. Zesty lemonade acidity is lively on the palate, leading to a long, softly foamed finish.",90,37.0,Champagne Blend,Sparkling Pointe,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5051,France,"The minerality is a reminder that the grapes come from an area near Chablis. It has a tangy, zingy character, with a nervy edge that promises aging, but it also provides fruity, apple-driven pleasure now.",91,30.0,Champagne Blend,Bailly-Lapierre,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5052,France,"A soft, gentle style of non-vintage Champagne, due perhaps to its relatively high dosage. But the whole wine is well in balance, the white fruits themselves giving a fine, elegant roundness.",88,49.0,Champagne Blend,Deutz,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5068,France,"N.P.U. standing for Nec Plus Ultra (translation “nothing further beyond”), this is a ultra-dry Champagne. It needs time to mature, so Bruno Paillard is to be congratulated for only now releasing the 1995 vintage. It has richness and freshness, the white fruits still scintillating in the glass. With the acidity over the ripe fruits, this could certainly age over the next five years or more.",94,220.0,Champagne Blend,Bruno Paillard,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5078,Argentina,"Ginger ale aromas and a foamy, gassy burn give this bubbly a personality similar to soda pop. The flavors are rather tart and green, with a note of green bean. Tastes and feels more narrow and vegetal than desired. On the plus side, it gets better the more it sits and the more you get to know it.",83,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Reginato,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5079,France,"Pale straw in color with a fine bead. As always, this is an elegant, distinctive and impeccably crisp Champagne.

5081,Spain,"Radiator dust, baked apple and other familiar, semirich aromas grace the nose on this more elevated Cava.

Made from 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay, it shows a hazelnut smokiness, with fantastically rich, subtle layers of limes, apples, tangerine zest, minerals and yeast. There's a honeyed richness to the finish, which balances high acidity, making it feel dry. A tremendous brut that should develop for years to come. Now–2020, in a cool cellar. Production was 50 cases.",98,147.0,Sparkling Blend,Iron Horse,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

Full in the mouth, with a perfect texture; the peach and nectarine flavors are delicious. Finishes a bit racy and citrusy, with pink grapefruit and passion fruit. Outstanding rosado cava. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez Selections.",91,25.0,Sparkling Blend,Llopart,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5089,France,"Organic, with clean, solid, forward aromas that blend in ginger and dust. The opening flavors are of orange and tangerine, while the second layer deals yeast and other drier elements. Great feel and balance, with zest throughout as well as touches of vanilla. Imported by Organic Vintners.",91,60.0,Champagne Blend,Fleury,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5090,Spain,"Lean on the bouquet; there's almost zero yeast or lees character. But there is an interesting smoked-meat aroma that conjures memories of sausage or ballpark franks. Aggressive in the mouth, with green herbs and paprika. An unusual cava with confusing characteristics.",86,70.0,Sparkling Blend,Parxet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5093,Spain,"Dusty, leesy aromas of apple and vanilla are sturdy. This brut Cava is fresh and modestly elegant on the palate, with lime, apple and tarragon flavors. A dry, confident finish offers apple and citrus flavors and a sense of ease.",89,17.0,Sparkling Blend,Bohigas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5094,Spain,"Clean and inviting, but simple, with apple and fresh-herb aromas. The palate is properly crisp yet not sharp, and the flavors of green apple and white grapes are snappy. Regular and a little better than good in every way, but ultimately more basic than special.",87,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Mont Paral,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5095,Australia,"This carbonated wine is soft and low in alcohol, with a sweet-tart character that comes across as slightly confected.",82,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Hesketh,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5096,France,"Soft and rounded with ripe apple and pear flavors, this wine expresses the richness of the vintage. Hints of toast and cookie are changing the fruit character, making this a wine that's ready to drink while still fresh, yet starting to show good aging as well.",90,139.0,Champagne Blend,Nicolas Feuillatte,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5097,US,"A blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier, this has citrus, raspberry, toast, vanilla and yeast flavors. The texture scours, with big, edgy bubbles and lots of acidity. Drink now.",88,25.0,Sparkling Blend,Halyard,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5098,US,"There's plenty of fanciness in this rich bubbly, with raspberry, strawberry, lime and vanilla flavors and that famous yeasty doughiness that characterizes good sparkling wine. Brisk in acidity, it's a little on the sweet side, but very clean.",87,22.0,Sparkling Blend,Mumm Napa,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5099,France,"Fresh and fruity, this creamy wine has apple and citrus flavors and a crisp shot of acidity. It is stylish, bubbly and a fine apéritif.",86,10.0,Sparkling Blend,Grandin,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5100,South Africa,"This Chenin Blanc-based sparkler is attractively light and approachable, with a fruity mélange of peach, pear and lychee aromas and flavors that are jazzed up by hints of sweet grass and pineapple-like acidity.

5102,US,"A little rough in texture and sweet on the finish, this pineappley brut is okay for everyday purposes, but the residual sugar is really too high for balance, especially at this price.",84,30.0,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5103,Spain,"Mineral, lime and crisp apple aromas give it a precise, pure nose. And that same character exists on the palate and finish, where white peach, green banana and melon flavors are full and forward. Shows good concentration and quality for a large-production bubbly at this price.",88,14.0,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5105,France,"Impressive, but so young, this is a Pinot Noir-dominated vintage, the richness as yet a mere hint in the welter of acidity and fruit. Already, though, this is   shaping up to be a structured, tight wine, with great final balance.",90,57.0,Champagne Blend,Mailly Grand Cru,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5106,US,"Delicious. This is a full-bodied blush bubbly with instant appeal, from the coppery color to the long, spicy finish.

Drink now.",93,36.0,Sparkling Blend,Domaine Carneros,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5107,US,"This is a delicious, brut-style wine, based on Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.

Great price for a bubbly this elegant.",90,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Mumm Napa,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5108,Italy,"Rotari's nonvintage bubbly places the emphasis on fruit, not yeasty, toasty elements. Pear and lemon curd notes glide into a soft, easy finish.",85,11.0,Champagne Blend,Rotari,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5109,France,"One of Aubry's two Champagnes from relatively rare grape varieties, this is a full-throated wine, replete with ripe fruit. Full bodied and rich, it has weight and intensity. Its yellow fruit is laced with complex acidity from citrus.",90,63.0,Champagne Blend,Aubry,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5110,US,"With its scoury, scratchy moutfeel, this wine lacks delicacy. But it is rich and layered in strawberries and red raspberries, and is easy to drink.",86,28.0,Sparkling Blend,Laetitia,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5111,Spain,"A sweet and cloying style of rosé. The bouquet is punch-bowl sweet, with mango and berry aromas, while the palate is like a fruit smoothie. Too sweet, with no edge.",81,14.0,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5112,Spain,"Dusty and with nice apple and spice aromas. The palate, however, is quite flat and devoid of a lively bubble bead. Flavors of pear and melon run sweet, while the finish is dull and lacks effervescence.",85,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Marqués de Gelida,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5113,US,"A beautiful blush wine, both to look at and to drink. The color is “the partridge's eye,” and in the mouth, the wine is fully dry, crisp and subtle in raspberries, tangerines, vanilla, brioche and spices. Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.",91,41.0,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5114,France,"This is a yeasty offering that's full on the palate, with a rich mousse. Yellow and white fruits contribute to its richness, a touch of bitterness balanced with the fruity acidity. Drink now, or age for a year.",87,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Wunsch & Mann,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5116,Argentina,"This opens with grassy, oxidized aromas of papaya and hay. The mouth is foamy and crude, with herbal, stalky flavors of salty, briny melon and nectarine. Not that it matters much, but the blend is Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc and Pinot Noir.",81,17.0,Sparkling Blend,Solsticio,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5117,US,"With abundant floral and stone-fruit notes on the nose and palate, this New York sparkler is on the sweet side of brut. Brisk in acidity and surprisingly pétillant, this $9 sparkler is an irresistible weeknight bubbly.",86,9.0,Sparkling Blend,Ambition,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5118,France,"This is without question a food Champagne. Toasty on the nose and powerful and full bodied on the palate, it is rich with sweet strawberries and just a touch of toast.",90,120.0,Champagne Blend,De Sousa & Fils,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5119,Argentina,"Burnt popcorn and some ammonia make the nose fairly harsh. Time softens it a bit as it yields to green-fruit flavors. Finishes dry as a soda cracker, with some Old World touches. Not an easy wine to enjoy; it's very lean and underdeveloped.",82,10.0,Sparkling Blend,Pascual Toso,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5120,Lithuania,"Waves of citrus, apple and pear, balanced by a crisp minerality that keeps the wine aloft on the palate, recommend this semi-dry sparkler from Lithuania.

5121,US,"This vividly effervescent sparkling Chardonnay offers notes of bruised apples and pears on the nose and a palate of rustic apple cider and lime pith flavors.

5122,Spain,"Better upon previous tastings. This time around it seems tough and rubbery, with a caustic burn to the nose. The palate is sweet and burnt, with caramel and raw berry fruit. Lacks freshness.",81,16.0,Sparkling Blend,Gran Gesta,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5123,Italy,"A blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Bianco and Pinot Nero, this savory sparkler opens with an inviting fragrance of baked bread, tangerine and red berry.

5124,France,"With all the extreme intensity of this vintage, this wine brings even more.

It is still young, just keep aging.",97,185.0,Champagne Blend,Henriot,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5127,France,"This wine balances extreme dryness with rich fruits. There is acidity, but the main fruit character is of ripe grapefruit and fresh apricots. It is structured, with green plum skins and orange zest, which give the wine a lift, and crispness, leaving a light, floating aftertaste.",90,30.0,Champagne Blend,Bailly-Lapierre,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5128,France,"Candied aromas call to mind confectioners' sugar, tart strawberries and bubble gum. Light and frothy in the mouth, picking up chalky, orangey notes on the finish.",84,33.0,Champagne Blend,Bauchet Père et Fils,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5129,Spain,"The green fruit and subtle, yeasty hay aromas are inviting. It feels nice and not abrasive, with notes of dried apple, citrus and rich, toasty yeast. It perks up on the finish, with dryness, zest and complexity. Very nice for $15.",89,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Loxarel,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5130,France,"Disgorged in May 2005, this is still not quite knit together, but the components are flavorful and appealing. There is plenty of ripe fruit hovering between citrus and tropical. And there is toast and perhaps a hint of butter, which softens the back end and lengthens the finish. But it doesn't completely hang together; it lurches a bit, like a car needing transmission work.",88,43.0,Champagne Blend,Bruno Paillard,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5131,South Africa,"Delicate, yeasty aromas of honey and citrus lead this semi-dry sparkler from Graham Beck. On the palate, sweet honey is balanced by citrus acidity.

5132,France,"This wine  has great style and elegance, as well as crisp northern fruit. There's just a touch of toastiness, along with flavors of almonds and white fruits. An apéritif-style wine, but could also work with light foods. Multiple U.S. importers.",88,12.0,Champagne Blend,Bailly-Lapierre,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5133,France,"Disgorged in 2009, this is a toasty wine, rich and concentrated. The idea of long aging before disgorging the yeast cells is to build up the unique complexity of the wine. In this Bollinger has succeeded magnificently. An opulent wine, with aging potential for 10 years or more.",97,260.0,Champagne Blend,Bollinger,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5134,US,"A simple, sweet blush bubbly, this is rough in texture, with raspberry, strawberry and vanilla flavors. It should be fine with wedding cake.",84,22.0,Sparkling Blend,Chandon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5135,Italy,"From the 2004 vintage, this Cuvée sparkling wine (80-20 Chardonnay and Pinot Nero) offers sophisticated aromas of baked bread, butterscotch and molasses. The color boasts a deep golden hue and the mouthfeel shows both impressive density and staying power.",91,51.0,Sparkling Blend,Quadra,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5136,US,"A delightful spray of cherry blossoms meanders from nose to finish in this standout Pinot Noir sparkling. Elegantly mouthfilling, it showcases whisper-soft cherry and plum flavors against a dazzling backbone of acidity and minerality. Grace and power synchronize through a long, long finish.",93,39.0,Sparkling Blend,Hermann J. Wiemer,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5137,Portugal,"Foamy and creamy in the mouth, this definitely moves into sweet melon, sweet cookies, yeast, but with enough acidity. It would work well with fresh fruits.",85,12.0,Portuguese Sparkling,Borges,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5138,Australia,"Simple and fruity, this coppery-pink sparkler is semisweet but reasonably balanced and clean. The peachy aromas and flavors make it a natural with fresh fruit.",84,13.0,Sparkling Blend,De Bortoli,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5139,Italy,"This offers intense aromas of acacia flower, peach blossom and apricot. The palate delivers citrus, walnut, bread crust and stone fruit flavors balanced by vibrant acidity and closes with a clean, dry finish. Perfect on its own or paired with delicately seasoned fish dishes.",90,28.0,Sparkling Blend,Lantieri de Paratico,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5140,Italy,"Plump and a bit gassy on the nose, but it settles to display firm flavors. Quite single-layered, with a crisp but monotone personality. Good mouthfeel, nothing out of whack, but rather basic in the final analysis. Imported by Paterno Wines International.",86,39.0,Sparkling Blend,Ca' del Bosco,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5141,Spain,"Dry melon and papaya aromas are common and proper for Cava. The palate, however, is ultrasweet and is weighted down by the wine's dosage. In the end, it's a candied type of bubbly that finishes cloyingly sweet and creamy. Best for fans of sweet white wines.",84,13.0,Sparkling Blend,Família Oliveda,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5142,Spain,"For Brut Nature, this has body and weight to it. The nose delivers dry apple and pear aromas, while the palate is fairly full and round for the style, with apple and lime flavors. A finish with roundness and density confirms this Cava's good quality.",86,14.0,Sparkling Blend,Biutiful,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5143,France,"Crisp and fresh, this is a light wine, dominated by acidity and slightly unripe grapefruit flavors. It's pleasant, if too acidic, but could soften with age. Keep a couple of years and try again.",87,52.0,Champagne Blend,Pannier,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5144,France,"With vineyards in the southern vineyards of the Aube, Vincent Couche makes a rich style of Champagne. This 2002 vintage, now maturing well, is ripe—almost opulent—in character. Its peach and apricot flavors shine at the fore, extended on the palate with a brisk, nervy texture.",91,54.0,Champagne Blend,Vincent Couche,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5145,Spain,"Dusty apple-driven aromas are simple but true to what brut Cava is about. This feels citric but a little flat, with pithy orange, tangerine and lime flavors that finish clean, crisp and short.",86,12.0,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5146,US,"A beautiful rosé sparkling wine, one that shows loads of finesse and elegance. But the final word is its deliciousness. Really captivates with subtle raspberry, toast, vanilla and yeasty brioche flavors that finish so crisp and clean.",90,27.0,Sparkling Blend,Mirabelle,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5147,Australia,"A blend of 68% Pinot Noir and 32% Chardonnay, this is one of the lighter-bodied Australian sparklers, featuring fruit-forward aromas of pineapple, vanilla and coconut. Flavors of citrus and toast are more standard fare; the wine finishes with good length, suggesting a few years of cellaring will do it no harm.",87,30.0,Champagne Blend,Petaluma,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5148,Ukraine,"Sweet blackberry and blueberry notes are deeply concentrated on the nose and palate of this Ukrainian semisweet red sparkler. Softly pétillant, it's unabashedly fun and fruity, but an enjoyable choice for casual entertaining.",85,13.0,Sparkling Blend,Artemovsk,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5149,France,"The palest of pinks announces the lightness of touch that makes this wine so attractive. Sure, it has ripe strawberry flavors, but they are delicate, laced with acidity, good freshness. A real apéritif wine.",90,75.0,Champagne Blend,Deutz,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5150,US,"Made from a majority Chardonnay with 23% Pinot Noir, this salmon-pinkish sparkler is a stunner, inviting in floral and fruity components and crisp acidity.

5151,Italy,"Compact, solid and well built, this sparkling wine from northern Italy delivers a nice aromatic package of stone fruit, toasted almond, Golden Delicious apple and yellow rose. The effervescence here is bright, persistent and cleansing.",89,14.0,Sparkling Blend,Rotari,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5152,France,"Rich and toasty, with tiny bubbles. The bouquet is laced with honey and vanilla scents. The palate suggests nuts and toast, without any noteworthy sweetness despite the demi-sec label. There’s good concentration and a ripe, toasty, slightly oxidized, nutty finish. This would work perfectly with the usual Champagne food suspects: foie gras, triple-cream cheeses and pâté, though it’s probably not the best choice for oysters.",91,30.0,Champagne Blend,Jacquart,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5153,US,"Full-bodied for a bubbly and slightly sweet, with forward flavors of cherries, strawberries, vanilla and brioche. Balanced with crisp acidity.",86,12.0,Sparkling Blend,Korbel,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5154,US,"Tastes a little sweet for a true brut, with sugary flavors of strawberries, raspberries and vanilla, and the finish is soft. The blend is French Colombard, Chardonnay and Sangiovese.",85,16.0,Sparkling Blend,Korbel,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5155,Spain,"Dry apple and crisp citrus aromas come with a touch of sweet grass. It has lively lemon-lime and apple flavors, and it seems to have beeen dosed on the sweeter side of extra dry. Overall, it's fruity, friendly and likable.",86,10.0,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5156,France,"A 50/50 blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, this is a full-bodied wine, with layers of toast and some good maturity. It has good nutty flavors, as well as white fruits, some bitter orange and a balanced, soft aftertaste. Imported by Tri-Vin Imports.",88,65.0,Champagne Blend,Jacquart,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5157,Italy,"This is a delicate and feminine rosé sparkler that opens with a beautifully pale pink color and subtle aromas of wild berry, tangerine skin, white almond and passion fruit. It shows elegance on the palate, with fine perlage and tangy crispness.",90,37.0,Sparkling Blend,Fratelli Berlucchi,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5158,France,"The wine starts soft, light and delicate, with some toast as well as creamy fruit. But that fruit goes fast, leaving a Champagne that has a high dosage, giving an aftertaste that is more sweet than fresh. This really should be better.",83,22.0,Champagne Blend,Kirkland Signature,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5159,US,"Made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, with a splash of Pinot Meunier, this bubbly is, in a word, delicious. It's so easy to drink, you can't put the glass down. Shows classic Champagne structure, with refined bubbles and brisk acidity. But the raspberry, strawberry, lime and apple flavors are pure California.",92,40.0,Sparkling Blend,Chandon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5160,Italy,"This refined sparkling wine has a classic Franciacorta fragrance of candied fruit, almond and just a whiff of vanilla. The palate delivers ripe peach and nut flavors andd a hint of bread crust. Fine perlage and a crisp, quenching finish.",90,67.0,Sparkling Blend,Ferghettina,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5161,Australia,"This soft, creamy rosé sparkler is cleanly made, but also rather sweet, with citrus and raspberry fruit. Imported by Pernod Ricard USA.",82,12.0,Champagne Blend,Jacob's Creek,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5162,Spain,"Ginger ale and Sprite are the first things that come to mind when you give it a sniff. The palate shows ripe and sweet orange, tangerine and pink grapefruit, while the back end is lean and citrusy but far short of complex. Good in a standard way.",87,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Codorníu,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5163,France,"Exceptionally rich and dense, an exceptional wine that reveals itself in layers, from the first fruit attack to the mineral texture and the way it gradually fills the mouth. Selected from old vines, there is a great flavor in this wine, with the promise of many years' aging.",97,229.0,Champagne Blend,Louis Roederer,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5164,France,"This sparkling wine is the only one made in the Chablis region. That's a shame, because with its great toasty character, crisp yellow fruit flavors and its beautifully delicate mousse, there should be more like it in Chablis. Imported by Louis Latour Inc.",90,13.0,Champagne Blend,Simonnet-Febvre,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5165,France,"wine's berry and apple aromas and flavors are only modest in their intensity, but they're clean, and the steady, fine bead makes for a light, refreshing mouthfeel.",83,8.0,Sparkling Blend,Louis Perdrier,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5166,Ukraine,"The nose is a tad dusty, with hints of unripe fruit and leaves, but the palate on this brut sparkling is clean and lemony, with a sharp, steely profile. Aggressive on the attack, with a stark, brisk acidity, it finishes with abundantly mouth-filling froth.",83,13.0,Sparkling Blend,Artemovsk,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5167,France,"This is an exceptional wine, as is the vintage. The fruits—grapefruit, crisp red apple—balance with a fine yeasty character. There is a great depth of flavor, the fruits going in a pure line of freshness. The one problem is that it is much too young, the result of the demand from the market for the next vintage. Age this wine for at least four years.",98,289.0,Champagne Blend,Louis Roederer,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5168,US,"This has a pale salmon color and aromas like those of Pinot Noir, including the walk-in-the-forest smell. Crisp cherry flavors lead to an intriguing mushroom note on the finish. Nearly dry, the texture is plush and soothing, while the finish is soft and lingering.",90,14.0,Sparkling Blend,Korbel,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5169,US,"A strongly flavored blush, forward and bold in cherries, raspberries, vanilla, smoke and spices, and even suggestions of exotic mulberries. Dark in color, too. Made mostly from Pinot Noir, it can stand in for a red wine with filet mignon. Should develop in the bottle beyond 2011.",92,50.0,Sparkling Blend,Iron Horse,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5170,Spain,"This vintage rosado is as good as always, but a bit lower on the quality ladder than previous years. The color is light pink and soft on the eye, while the nose suggests brick dust and orange peel. Smooth and easygoing, with sweet, generic flavors of orange and berry.",87,22.0,Sparkling Blend,Llopart,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5171,France,"Like the regular Grande Dame, the aim here is finesse. It's softer and more elegant than Clicquot's vintage rosé, with delicate hints of cherry, toast, mushroom and citrus. Long, tight and tannic on the finish, this wine is worth cellaring.",92,200.0,Champagne Blend,Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5172,France,"Crisp, fresh sparkling wine, lightly creamy but more going towards green fruits, tight acidity. It doesn't need any bottle aging and really should be drunk in the next year to keep its essential freshness.",86,17.0,Sparkling Blend,Manuel Olivier,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5173,US,"The opulence of this sparkling wine has to be tasted to be believed. It's far softer and silkier than the winery's companion new release, the 2005 J. Schram, but then the blend is the complete opposite. This one's mainly Pinot Noir, with the balance from Chardonnay. The Pinot Noir brings a warm, raspberry- and cherry-sauce richness to Chardonnay's limes and pears, while an extraordinarily delicious toastiness pervades the whole, as if it had been gently smoked. So enticing now, it's hard to keep from drinking the whole bottle, and you certainly can, but this is a wine that will age for 10–15 years.",98,110.0,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5174,Spain,"All over the map. The nose offers toast offset by gym sweat, while the palate is both tangy yet pickled, with zingy orange flavors. The wine flows across the tongue but leaves a bit of citrus rind and vinegar. Not bad per se, but has some weak links. Imported by Winelink Imports.",83,10.0,Sparkling Blend,Dibon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5175,Spain,"Nothing wrong with this pleasant, friendly Cava. The nose boasts frosted breakfast cereal and lemon curd, while the palate is defined by spiced apple and baked citrus. It gets more honeyed and fat as it opens, although a good chilling will keep that in check.",87,11.0,Sparkling Blend,Giró Ribot,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5176,US,"This four-county blend is a selection of what the winemakers consider their best lots of the vintage. Made from 86% Chardonnay and 14% Pinot Noir, it most certainly needs some time in the cellar, as it's scoury right now. But its richness is already apparent: it shows complex toast, leesy yeast, crème brûlée, lemondrop sour candy and ripe pear flavors. A gorgeous sparkling wine that will benefit from at least 12 years of aging.",95,115.0,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5177,France,"Despite its description as “extra dry,” this is in fact sweeter than a brut. This is fresh and fruity, with an attractive apple-purée flavor, balanced by crisp acidity and a light, bright finish.",89,52.0,Champagne Blend,Louis Roederer,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5178,France,"Fully rounded, and crisply dry, this has a great foamy, creamy texture, filled out with red apple skins, pink grapefruit and an open aftertaste. Is the aftertaste just a touch sweet? Perhaps, but that seems to be part of the balance, and not out of place.",89,37.0,Champagne Blend,Vranken,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5179,France,"With its 20% of Aligoté (80% Chardonnay), the wine is particularly light and bubbly. Its acidity is intense, giving a grapefruit and lemon juice character. It tastes very dry, relying on ripe fruit for its final softness.",87,23.0,Sparkling Blend,Parigot & Richard,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5180,France,"This wine was made from grapes grown on the Petit Thouars estate by sparkling-wine producer Langlois-Château.

Drink now.",88,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Château du Petit Thouars,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5181,Spain,"A bit heavy and corny, with a strong influence of tortilla and corn chips on the nose. On the palate, it's crisp, with modest flavors of salt, baked apple and dried papaya. Dry, mellow and ultimately short on the finish.",86,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Ferré I Catasús,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5182,France,"With this vintage, disgorged in June 2007, there is still great youth. But the fine raspberry and other red fruit flavors make this a well-balanced Champagne, leaning on fruit at this stage, but also showing structure.",88,57.0,Champagne Blend,Chanoine,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5183,France,"A wood-fermented wine (in 225 litre barrels), this is naturally a rich Champagne. With the added ripeness of 2003, this is big-hearted, glowing with yellow fruits, the lightest touch of wood and a generous, full and balanced aftertaste.",92,90.0,Champagne Blend,Nicolas Feuillatte,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5184,France,"Round and fruity, this is cleanly made, with its soft character coming from the ripe strawberry fruit. It's a good candidate to pair with a fruit dessert or to serve as an apéritif.",85,10.0,Sparkling Blend,Veuve du Vernay,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5185,Italy,"Festive and less formal, this is a luminous sparkler with ripe melon, peach and toasted nutty notes that hits all the right marks.

5188,France,"Even at 10 years, this is still just setting out. While it doesn't have the immensity of the 1996, it has a great intense grapefruit, pear and fresh apricot series of flavors that come through with toast, ripeness and a suggestion of almonds. 7–8 years aging.",97,275.0,Champagne Blend,Pol Roger,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5189,Italy,"Grapefruit, apple and walnut aromas lead the nose on this graceful blend of 80% Chardonnay and 20% Pinot Nero.

Drink now through 2018.",90,36.0,Sparkling Blend,Majolini,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5190,France,"A mature Champagne, this shows as much toast and cookie character as fruit, making it soft, ripe and delicious. The fruit moves toward tropical, with pineapple and peach flavors. It is not a wine to age.",93,120.0,Champagne Blend,Duval-Leroy,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5191,France,"The dosage level is 45g/l, which makes this wine a bit sweet, but not cloying. Toast and candied citron aromas and some honeyed apple and lemon flavors. Decanting reduces the apparent acidity, thereby raising the perception of sweetness.",87,50.0,Champagne Blend,Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5193,US,"The DSM sparklers all come in a fancy package, all are méthode champenoise, all finished with a wire cage and Champagne cork.

Michelle,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5194,France,"A wine made by using the color from the grape skins rather than the more normal Champagne method of adding red wine to give color to rosé.

5199,France,"The Bollinger style is always rich, food friendly and impressive.

5200,France,"Warm and rich, even if still young, this is a rounded Champagne, full of ripe apple and spice, pink grapefruit, lined with intense acidity. Because it is still so young, it needs several years' aging.",92,99.0,Champagne Blend,Drappier,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5201,Hungary,"This is a stylish, sparkling dessert wine at a good price. Lush and lovely on the nose, with layers of perfumed flowers and spice, the wine offers sweet but delicate flavors on the palate.

5203,France,"You can tell that Pinot Noir dominates this wine. It is big, powerful, hinting at raspberries as well as delicious richness.

The final is a play on richness and structure.",93,55.0,Champagne Blend,Pehu-Simonet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5204,France,"Fresh crushed strawberries combine with a ripe and sweet texture to give a delicious, glowing rosé. It is full in the mouth, with a touch of sweeter fruits, although acidity does give the wine a final lift.",89,99.0,Champagne Blend,Laurent-Perrier,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5206,US,"Made from Pinot Noir, although the color is golden straw, and the wine is light and airy in the mouth. The raspberry and strawberry flavors are the giveaway. Absolutely delicious, with a refined mouthfeel, and the price is a bargain.",90,22.0,Sparkling Blend,Chandon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5207,Spain,"Baked apple and spice aromas form a recognizable bouquet, while the palate oozes with grapefruit and tart apple flavors. This is zesty, clean, a little bit lean and fresh.

5208,Spain,"Aromas of scrambled eggs are cidery and flat. This feels soft and unfocused, with low acidity and a mild bead. Green flavors of lettuce and herbs are more salad-like than fruity, while the finish is soft and lacking in edge.",84,13.0,Sparkling Blend,En Fuego,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5209,France,Showing signs of toasty maturity. Rosé Champagne does age but it becomes much more like regular (white) Champagne.

5210,US,"Chandon's smaller production sparkler, the étoile Brut is 52% Chardonnay, 37% Pinot Noir and 11% Pinot Meunier, with most of the grapes grown in Napa and Sonoma though the wine is given a North Coast label. It has a toastiness akin to creme brûlée, a bite of yellow cider apple and almond that's quite savory and a medium finish.",90,40.0,Sparkling Blend,Domaine Chandon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5212,Spain,"The bouquet delivers some of that creamy, corn-like smell that many Cavas show. There is also cereal and citrus to the nose. Flavors of nectarine, grapefruit and green herbs are fresh and in the lead, and the feel is soft-edged. Shows some green bitterness on the finish.",86,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Gran Rigau,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5213,France,"A ripe, soft wine that still does manage to preserve the Ayala lightness of touch. The fruit is green apple and pink grapefruit, with great freshness. The structure, though, is open and hints of yeast show through the fruit. The aftertaste is deliciously fresh.",92,65.0,Champagne Blend,Ayala,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5214,Spain,"I love the funky amphora-shaped bottle as much as the forward nature of the wine. Starts with a full blast of toast, which is backed by a richer butterscotch aroma. This is a cava that provides a big mouthful; the palate is dry and wheaty, while the backing flavors of cinnamon and apple are live-wire.",90,52.0,Sparkling Blend,Agustí Torelló,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5215,US,"Not really dry, but actually a little sweet, with a honey-sugar edge to the strawberries, raspberries, limes and vanilla. Feels clean and crisp and fine in the mouth. The blend is Chenin Blanc, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and French Colombard.",86,12.0,Sparkling Blend,Korbel,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5216,France,"Crisp, very dry wine that projects its red berry acidity right to the front. Certainly for food, it is textured with a steely core and likely to benefit from a few more months in bottle.",87,53.0,Champagne Blend,J. Dumangin Fils,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5217,Spain,"Dry, smoky and lightly fruity, this Pinot Noir-based Cava is about as good as it gets in the price range.

5219,France,"This retains so much freshness, with just a hint of toast showing at the back of a wine that otherwise projects minerality, a tight structure and intense citrus acidity. It should be aged for several more years.",92,55.0,Champagne Blend,Charles Ellner,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5225,France,"One of the major names in Riquewihr, Dopff et Irion has made a fine, fresh, if rather too soft Crémant. It is easy, clean, crisp and fine as an apéritif wine.",85,22.0,Sparkling Blend,Dopff & Irion,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5226,South Africa,"This offers very pretty flavors at a reasonable price, making it a good choice for everyday drinking or a celebration where quantity is needed. Buttery, warm aromas mingle with a crisp, flinty sparkle in the nose and on the palate. It's on the sweet side but that lively zip keeps the wine aloft. Half Pinot Noir, half Chardonnay.

5227,France,"A rare rosé made by obtaining the color from the skins of the Pinot during maceration, rather than by adding red wine.

Imported by Duval-Leroy Imports.",91,42.0,Champagne Blend,Duval-Leroy,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5228,US,"Super-fruity now, almost too much so for a sparkling wine. Tastes like a Chardonnay with bubbles. But of course the wine is still young at the age of six-plus years. It wants time in the cellar. Should develop slowly and well over the next decade, acquiring nutty, dried fruit and honey complexities.",92,85.0,Sparkling Blend,Domaine Carneros,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5229,US,"A little sweet, which makes the wine less subtle, this Pinot Noir and Chardonnay blend has jammy raspberry, cherry and vanilla smoke flavors. The finish is very sweet.",85,40.0,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

Imported by Ex-Cellars Wine Agencies, Inc.",92,65.0,Champagne Blend,Philipponnat,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5235,US,"The winery rarely produces single-vineyard bubblies, so when they do, it's because their team believes in the bottling. And when you taste this 100% Chardonnay, you understand why. It's dry and rich in acidity, with yeasty lees and toast that frame gorgeous tangerine, Meyer lemon, lime and vanilla bean flavors. The mousse is ultrarefined, making it great for drinking now. This sparking wine could age until at least 2024, gradually losing effervescence and primary fruit but gaining in subtlety.",96,70.0,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5236,England,"Both the fruit and the aromatic foliage of wild raspberries rise first from the glass. They are followed by richer, delicious strawberry and cream notes, with hints of almond patisserie and strawberry shortcake. The palate is resonant with yeasty, rounded autolytic notes that frame the wonderfully wilful English hedgerow character. The mousse is lively but soft and the finish long and echoing.",94,44.0,Sparkling Blend,Wiston Estate Winery,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5243,France,"Starts with sweet scents of bread dough, light herb and green apple. Well-made, with lean, fresh flavors of apple and pear.

5251,Spain,"Here's a serious Cava with Champagne qualities. The nose is nutty and rich, with hints of vanilla and popcorn that aren't overdone. The palate is toasty but also candied, with citrus blending perfectly with butterscotch. Plump and ripe through the finish, this is high-end and stylish, as Spanish bubbly goes. Drink now or hold in a good cellar for a few more years.",92,46.0,Sparkling Blend,Gramona,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5252,US,"The vintage was a very ripe one, and the heat shows. It's very forward, almost jammy, in sweet strawberry and peach flavors. This robs the wine of some elegance and finesse, but it's still an attractive sipper.",85,25.0,Sparkling Blend,Domaine Carneros,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

It will be a fine fit with food.",92,45.0,Sparkling Blend,Gloria Ferrer,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5258,France,"The latest edition of the Excéllence is the best in years. The crisp young flavors—like a tart green apple—are focused and unusually intense.

5259,US,"This is a very dry, elegant bubbly that drinks “French” because the dominant notes are earthy, minerally and toasty, rather than fruity.

5262,Spain,"Light and lean, with lively fruit aromas and flavors. Freshness is what this wine pushes, because there's not much weight or overt sweetness to it.

5266,US,"Made from 85% Flora, 9% Pinot Noir and 6% Chardonnay in a Méthode Traditionelle style, with 3.5 g/L of residual sugar, this wine is dry on the nose, while taking on a slightly sweeter, velvety texture on the palate. Apple and brioche combine with a touch of anise, vanilla and peach for a smooth, intoxicating quaff that's entirely enjoyable.",91,39.0,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5267,Spain,"Creamy aromas of custard give off a soapy smell. This feels citric, while nectarine and orange flavors are a bit funky. On the finish, this is more fresh and direct than flavorful.",86,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Camps d'Estels,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5268,Italy,"Made with 70% Pinot Nero and 30% Chardonnay, this salmon-colored sparkler opens with aromas of woodland berries, pastry cream and baking spices.

5269,US,"Very full-bodied and richly forward in raspberries, cherries and oranges, with the yeasty lees and toast of sparkling wine. A little too big for classic elegance, but dry and easy to like.",87,36.0,Sparkling Blend,Domaine Carneros,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5270,US,"Not really dry but off-dry, this bubbly is rich, with honeyed flavors of raspberries, cherries, pineapples, apples and brioche. A pleasant sipper.",87,22.0,Sparkling Blend,Chandon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5271,Spain,"With aromatic touches of haystack and vanilla in addition to green apple and mineral, the nose is inviting. On the palate, it's nice and lemony, with green apple acids offering a modest scour. Cleansing and ideal with simple finger foods. Very nice for the price.",88,10.0,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5272,Italy,"Using the Metodo Classico, this shows bright aromas of citrus, mountain flower and apricot. The mouthfeel is round and smooth, with a playful touch of bitter almond on the close.",88,35.0,Sparkling Blend,Arunda,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5273,Spain,"The smell of honey and lemon-lime soda give this a basic but respectable opening. It's sort of foamy and plump in the mouth, with apple and green-herb flavors. Lacks a little touch but offers bouncy fruit and no overt faults. Imported by Winelink Imports.",86,14.0,Sparkling Blend,Dibon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5274,Spain,"Fresh and full of lime on the nose, and overall this is simple, smooth and gives you little reason to worry or fuss. The palate is smooth, creamy and a little low on acids, thus the lemon-lime and melon flavors have a fullness that's sweet and good.",86,10.0,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5275,US,"Mainly Pinot Noir, with just 15% Chardonnay, this full-bodied bubbly has notes of seemingly sweet raspberries. The mouthfeel is slightly coarse. Still, it shows plenty of elegance, and if you're toasting the wedding couple, it's just fine.",87,38.0,Sparkling Blend,Iron Horse,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5276,Spain,"In a small field of excellent Cavas, this bready, leesy, semi-rich bottling stands out for its totality and comfort on the palate. Along the road are aromas of burnt banana and toasted bread along with flavors of arugula, lime and dried apple. An elegant finish with stone-fruit and green-herb notes is sophisticated.",90,35.0,Sparkling Blend,Llopart,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5277,France,"While the style is soft, full of yellow fruit richness, the wine also show an excellent concentrated texture. The fresh fruit is integrated into this more complex style. The aftertaste shows some softness, but the wine can certainly age for several years.",91,92.0,Champagne Blend,Lallier,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5278,France,"This is a crisp, high-wire-walking wine, just so poised. Its youthful red fruits, laced with citrus, taste so fresh, with a strawberry bite. At this stage, it is intensely enjoyable as young Champagne, but it does need to age for several years.",94,67.0,Champagne Blend,Louis Roederer,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5279,Italy,"A silky blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Bianco and Pinot Nero, this elegant classic method sparkling wine opens with citrus, peach and floral aromas of jasmine and honeysuckle. Its rich fruit flavors and delicately toasted flavors would pair with smoked salmon canapés.",89,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Quadra,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5280,US,"This blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier feels a little scouring. It has sweet-tasting flavors of raspberry jam, toast, vanilla and yeast. Drink this bubbly now.",87,32.0,Sparkling Blend,Sinnet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5281,England,"An abundance of apple flavors—green, golden and red-cheeked—plays on the nose. Their crisp, crunchy, sweet tartness is apparent everywhere and explodes afresh with every tiny bubble that bursts. Creamy autolysis provides a generous background to this fizzing, fun wine. This is light-footed, exuberant and finishes with a joyous concert of apple-delight.",91,75.0,Sparkling Blend,Jenkyn Place Vineyard,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5283,France,"By far the best wine in the Louis Bouillot range, this is full, crisp and layered with toastiness. It has taken on flavors of honey, spices and vanilla from its wood aging. A fine wine, dry to taste and finishing crisp and full-bodied. Imported by Boisset America.",90,16.0,Champagne Blend,Louis Bouillot,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5284,France,"This creamy wine has a distinct mature and toasty character to balance the crisp white fruits and lively acidity. It is on the sweeter end of Brut, which adds richness to this attractive nonvintage.",90,45.0,Champagne Blend,Perrier Jouët,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5285,Italy,"Amber/salmon in color, with earthy, complex aromas of dried leaves, cherry and toast. More spicy and sly than overtly fruity, with dried plum and apricot flavors. Nice and smooth in the mouth and persistent on the finish. Gets better with airing, as it opens to show a smoky and nuanced alter ego. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd.",89,59.0,Sparkling Blend,Bellavista,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5286,France,"An intensely fruity Champagne, made for the Tsars of Russia, this is crisp with apple and citrus flavors. It has some depth, with a tight, steely texture and grapefruit acidity. There is some softness on the finish.",89,60.0,Champagne Blend,Chanoine,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5287,Spain,"Disappointing considering the price. There's no good reason to pay $40 for a cava that's cidery and offers hints of vinegar along the way. That said, this is not a cheaply made disaster unworthy of a rating; still, it's austere and hints at sauerkraut.",80,40.0,Sparkling Blend,Maria Casanovas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5288,France,"Probably the best-selling Champagne brand in the world, with a production of over 30 million bottles a year, Moët's quality is consistent. It has a ripeness and richness, and in this bottle, some bottle age. This bottling is not hugely fruity, but it has more to offer than just fruit. Imported by Moët Hennessy USA.",89,38.0,Champagne Blend,Moët & Chandon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5289,France,"The current release of the vintage wine, the 1998 seems a touch richer than the '99, with hints of brioche, mushroom and ginger to its citrusy flavors. Round and soft in the mouth, but also a little short on the finish.",89,76.0,Champagne Blend,Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5290,US,"Like a pastry shop in a glass, this rare treat of a well-aged bubbly smells of cream, butter and nutmeg, and tastes like baked apples, almonds and vanilla. Although not sweet, its generous fruit, spice and nut nuances build on the crisp but smooth texture and linger on the finish. From a cool vintage that produced long-lived wines, this is irresistible now but should keep through 2020.",97,175.0,Champagne Blend,Schramsberg,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5291,US,"Argyle's Extended Tirage benefits from all the extra bottle age. It's far and away the smoothest and toastiest of the winery's current sparkling wine releases, lavishing toasted hazelnut and toasted coconut flavors along with dried apple, papaya and lemon rind. Complex yet still nicely fruity.",91,50.0,Sparkling Blend,Argyle,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5292,Italy,"Definitely off-dry in character, with caramel corn, doughnut and apples on the nose. Additional applesauce flavors blend with canned pear to create a sweet, sugary, lingering whole.

5295,US,"Notes of pressed apple and burnt sugar on the nose and palate of this sparkler made entirely of Seyval Blanc grapes are reminiscent of a dry, French apple cider. Juicy and full bodied with a stout frame and frothy, medium-sized bubbles.",84,30.0,Sparkling Blend,Clinton,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5296,Spain,"Dusty and straightforward on the nose, this has aromas of pear and apple. It feels simple, tight and not overly evolved, with a peach flavor that's not too complex. Zesty in feel, this tastes a bit like vitamins and nuts on the finish.",86,12.0,Sparkling Blend,Sàniger,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5297,France,"This is an attractive, fruity wine, produced in Meursault. It is fresh with lemon and tangy orange-zest flavors. A light tannic texture adds an edge to the fresh fruit.",87,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Charles Duret,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5299,France,"A Pinot Noir-dominated Champagne from 70-year-old vines, this is gorgeous, rich and concentrated. It has certainly benefitted from its aging before release. With a small production of 11,000 bottles, this is both serious and impressive.",93,90.0,Champagne Blend,Mailly Grand Cru,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5300,France,"Based in Vougeot in the heart of the Côte d'Or, Labet makes a delicious Crémant, appley, crisp and fresh. Offers pretty flavors of kiwis, green plums and a touch of toast. Imported by Vintners Edge.",90,19.0,Champagne Blend,Francois Labet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5301,France,"A blend of Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay, this is crisp while also rounded. Fresh, tight acidity under a creamy texture brings out the sliced apple and Rocha pear flavors. There's no need to age this bottling; it's ready to drink.",88,50.0,Champagne Blend,H. Blin,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5302,Spain,"Woody notes of sawdust and cinnamon stick drive a mostly fruitless nose. This feels lean and fresh, but foamy. Dry, salty and savory more than fruity, this blend of Trapat and Garnacha finishes steady, with notes of citrus fruits.",86,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Carbó,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5303,England,"A lifting mix of golden, ripe apple, chamomile, moss and honey signals richness and some maturity. The palate is poised and holds all of these flavours tightly in a soaring, slender structure that is built on a firm foundation of bright acidity and subtle earthiness. Grown-up, taut, generous and poised, this is a honey-edged homage to the South Downs.",94,38.0,Sparkling Blend,Ridgeview Estate,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5304,France,"Are delicate and full-bodied contradictions? Not here, with this ripe, red-fruit-flavored wine, which still creeps delicately around the palate.

5306,France,"Fermented in 225-liter barrels, this is a rich, full-flavored wine touched with hints of toast and brisk acidity. The palate is weighty, but there's a crisp, dry fruit quality on the palate. Still youthful, it's not quite integrated yet, so keep until 2016.",91,90.0,Champagne Blend,Nicolas Feuillatte,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5307,Italy,"Here's a sophisticated wine from Franciacorta near Brescia in Northern Italy. The wine region straddles a lake and is well suited to Chardonnay, Pinot Nero and other grapes used in sparkling wines. Here you get aromas of sourdough, apricot and dried fruit.",90,40.0,Sparkling Blend,Lantieri de Paratico,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5308,France,"Light and elegant, this spicy, lively wine is a gentle joy. There is a precision and refinement evident here that makes other Champagnes seem almost clumsy. The delicate flavors of fresh apple, pear and citrus are further enhanced with pretty cinnamon spice.",92,30.0,Champagne Blend,Jacquart,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5309,Spain,"Lightly pickled, briny aromas are distant. In the mouth, this feels pinched and high in citric acid, but also refined. Flavors of grapefruit and passion fruit are tart, while lime and tangerine flavors are prominent on a briny, tart finish.",87,29.0,Sparkling Blend,Pere Ventura,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5310,France,"A floral nose and a very soft mouthfeel characterize this easy bubbly.  With somewhat sweet, flowery flavors, it's really a demi-sec, and will have wide appeal.  Finishes modestly and a little drier than the palate.  It's a touch simple but makes no pretense, and is a decent inexpensive pour.",84,11.0,Sparkling Blend,Grandin,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5311,France,"Very dry and rich, this is a taut, tense bottling of Goutorbe's rosé. It has apple and red currant flavors, laced with intense acidity and a bright texture. With more bottle aging, it could be an apéritif wine. For now, it is best with food.",90,60.0,Champagne Blend,Henri Goutorbe,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5312,Spain,"Avinyo does not make cookie-cutter cavas, and thus this wine is out of the ordinary and not always the better for it. The nose is lean and spritzy, with aromas equal to lemon-lime. The palate is drawn in for a brut, with tart flavors. Slim in profile, but not a bad or indifferent wine.",85,16.0,Sparkling Blend,Avinyó,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5313,Spain,"Modest and generally clean on the nose, this features little more than a touch of berry. It feels tight and juicy, with citrus flavor and not much complexity. A note of pink grapefruit shows up on the finish.",86,17.0,Sparkling Blend,Marqués de Gelida,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5314,Argentina,"Quite neutral and distant on the nose, with dry apple flavors working the soft, balanced palate. There are complexities such as white pepper and nutty nuances, but in the end it's an average sparkler with a controlled approach. Good for Argentina but probably not ready to compete with the world's best $20 sparkling wines.",85,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Cave Extrême,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5315,France,"A blend of Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier, this is a rich Champagne. It has layers of red currant fruits and intense acidity. There is some toast coming through as this wine has aged.",89,59.0,Champagne Blend,Beaumont des Crayères,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5316,US,"Foxy, animal aromas begin your experience with this bubbly. It's rough and fruity, with a dose of sugar. It has a low price going for it, but most wine enthusiasts won't find much to like here.",80,10.0,Champagne Blend,Great Western,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5317,Italy,"This sophisticated metodo classico sparkler has deep complexity thanks to well-rendered notes of yeast and toast that recall apple pie crust or fresh baking bread. It's a full, generous wine with round tones, lively perlage and a fine point of acidity on the close.",92,63.0,Sparkling Blend,Bellavista,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5318,France,"Very crisp and very fresh, this thrives on its bright sliced apple flavors. A tight texture gives a lemon tang. It's still young and should be given until late 2015.",89,50.0,Champagne Blend,Veuve Doussot,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5319,US,"Just about half Chardonnay and half Pinot Noir, with a touch of Pinot Meunier, this fruit-forward bubbly  tastes sweet, even by California sparkling wine standards. It's almost what the French call demi-sec, with sugared lemon mousse and raspberry-vanilla cream flavors.",84,32.0,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5320,France,"This lovely tete de cuvée shows off a mature, sweet bready nose with light citrus accents. It hits the palate with assertive, full green apple, bright citrus fruit complemented by strong leesy notes. Quite young and lively despite its age, it closes long with complex lemon and yeast flavors, and should even improve with a few more years in the bottle.",89,80.0,Champagne Blend,J. de Telmont,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5321,France,"Fresh and citrusy on the nose, with only the faintest hint of toasty, autolytic character. Lemon and grapefruit flavors come across as slightly coarse and rustic before a burnt note creeps in on the finish.",83,17.0,Sparkling Blend,Langlois-Chateau,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5322,France,"A very dry style of Champagne that needs food. At this stage, this wine is young, with vibrant acidity  and dense, green fruit. But it has a long future ahead of it, and shortly should show some toast and maturity. Serve this with fish, and appreciate its qualities even more. Imported by Robert Chadderdon Selections.",95,120.0,Champagne Blend,Billecart-Salmon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5323,France,"Salmon-colored, with nice scents of strawberry and leafy red berry, this sparkler has big, zesty bubbles and flavors of lime and citrus touched with red berry. Crisp on the finish, with citrusy-apple flavors.",86,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Bouvet-Ladubay,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5324,France,"Richer than many Champagnes from 2007 that focus on delicacy, this ripe, full-bodied wine has a dominance (75%) of fruity, textured Pinot Noir. It features berry fruits, fresh pears and quince, along with a great clean line of acidity. Drink now and until 2018.",90,55.0,Champagne Blend,Mailly Grand Cru,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5325,France,"Creamy wine, with pure acidity and a green apple character. It tastes young, herbal, while the aftertaste is soft.",86,40.0,Champagne Blend,Philippe Prié,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5326,France,"Even with some bottle age, this is a ripe and fruity wine. With a good edge of toastiness, it has lost its initial freshness, while gaining a round, rich character. It has great acidity and crispness on the finish.",91,63.0,Champagne Blend,H. Blin,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5327,France,"Soft-fruited Champagne, with pear and pink grapefruit flavors. It has a bitter almond edge that cuts through the acidity. The finish is soft, towards the sweet end of brut.",85,35.0,Champagne Blend,Heidsieck & Co Monopole,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5328,US,"Honey and lemon accent the nose and palate of this stately flagship wine from Sparkling Pointe. Extended lees aging lends remarkable depth and complexity—shades of brioche and almond add a richness on the palate. Revitalizing acidity and a train of tiny bubbles lead to a soft, pillowy foam.",91,60.0,Champagne Blend,Sparkling Pointe,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5329,France,"Dry, yes, but this wine is also soft and ripe. It has an attractive toasty character giving power to the midpalate. It's in the finish that the real acidity and dryness show most.",87,52.0,Champagne Blend,Mailly Grand Cru,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5330,US,"An unusual, but very good, bubbly. Made from Pinot Noir and with the color of the first blush of a peach, it offers a blast of cherry, raspberry and vanilla flavors that finish dry, long and clean.",90,30.0,Sparkling Blend,Chandon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5331,Hungary,"White flower and pink bubblegum notes lend a slightly confected tone to this semisweet Hungarian sparkling wine, but it's an undeniably drinkable, peach-flavored sip, with sharp effervescence and a tasty sugar-cookie finish.",85,13.0,Sparkling Blend,Törley,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5332,France,"A rich wine with crisp apple and grapefruit flavors as well as a touch of sweetness, Lanson's non-vintage Brut always has fine acidity with just a hint of toast indicating some bottle age. It's bottled ready to drink.",90,50.0,Champagne Blend,Lanson,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5333,Spain,"Cristalino is always a solid go-to Cava. This brut is round, slightly yeasty and shows citrus aromas that veer toward lemon-lime. The palate is healthy and clean, with a narrow set of citrus and apple flavors. Fairly full and long on the finish, which makes the whole package more than worthwhile given the cost.",88,9.0,Sparkling Blend,Cristalino,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5334,France,"With a touch of caramel aromas, this appears initially soft. But the palate is very dry and light, balanced with flavors of lychees and red fruits. Finishes with clean acidity. Imported by Vintus LLC.",90,55.0,Champagne Blend,Bruno Paillard,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5335,Argentina,"Cheese and crackers on the nose, meaning it's not all that fruity and clean. In the mouth, it's also bisquits and cheddar city. And the feel is round and foamy, with a dry, chalky finish that erases much of what came prior. One can only say this bubbly has its issues.",82,30.0,Champagne Blend,Valentin Bianchi,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5336,France,"A very soft wine that just hints at a crisp food character. Everything is there—the fruit, acidity and a tight texture—but the wine overall shows an indistinct, unfocused character.",84,45.0,Champagne Blend,De Venoge,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5337,Italy,"Creamy, dense and packed tight with aromas of mature fruit, melon and apricot, this pretty sparkling blend could pair with creamy shrimp risotto or seared tuna. There's a touch of butterscotch and bitter almond on the finish.",88,23.0,Sparkling Blend,Cornaleto,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5338,Spain,"Yeasty, briny scents define the nose on this smooth, round-bodied Cava. Flavors of apple, lime, tarragon and lemongrass veer towards green, while the finish is slightly oxidized, which results in a bready aftertaste and a soft ending texture.",88,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Marqués de Gelida,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5339,France,"Richly colored in hues of amber and gold, with a toasty, full-bodied nose that offers maturity and depth.

5341,France,"Ayala specializes in dry Champagnes and this is their extreme example. It has the right amount of bottle age to soften the intense acidity and bring in some toastiness and fruit. It can be drunk now, but a few more months in bottle would make it even better.",91,75.0,Champagne Blend,Ayala,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5344,France,"A light-bodied, somewhat austere sparkler that's short on fruit but long on mineral and earthy notes suggesting wet clay and chalk. Finishes fresh.",84,16.0,Sparkling Blend,Pierre Sparr,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5345,Spain,"Dusty and yeasty on the nose, this has an eggy, sweaty note. It feels good but drifts a bit on the palate, while the flavors run stalky and sweet, with a touch of apple for crispness.",83,10.0,Sparkling Blend,Jaume Serra,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5346,France,"Pascal and Laure Doquet produce Chardonnay-dominated wines. This 1997 premier cru has 25% Pinot Noir in the blend, giving a rich, cookie-and-toast character just beginning to show through the fresh, green fruits. It is finely balanced, very pure.",90,63.0,Champagne Blend,Pascal Doquet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5348,US,"A nice everyday sparkler. It's a little sweet and very forward in lime and strawberry flavors, with the yeast and toast complications of a fine sparkling wine.",87,22.0,Sparkling Blend,Gloria Ferrer,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5349,France,"Tight acidity dominates this top cuvée from Blin, and between that and its strong citrus character, it needs time to breathe before drinking. Then it fills out with delicious, refreshing acidity, followed by a crisp finish.",92,70.0,Champagne Blend,H. Blin,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5350,US,"Not as dry as the name suggests, this offering seems fairly sweet, with sugary lime, orange and vanilla flavors. You'll find a rich streak of doughy yeast and acidity, giving it that typical Champagne note.",86,13.0,Sparkling Blend,Korbel,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5351,US,"This compelling and delicious bottling has a grand bearing, sophisticated flavors and elegant texture, like something the staff at Downton Abbey would serve.

Flavors are subtle, dry but somehow rich, as hints of white peach, almond and dried cherry develop.",94,110.0,Champagne Blend,Schramsberg,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5352,Spain,"Apple and powdery citrus aromas are austere but intriguing. But in the mouth, this thing foams like bubble bath. No matter whether you like the wine's citric flavors and apple essence or not, the fact that it bubbles up like a shaken soda is not an attribute. Oriel's gran reserva is similar in terms of carbonation issues.",82,18.0,Sparkling Blend,Oriol Rossell,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5353,Italy,"Lemonade-like sweetness on the nose is enhanced by notes of green herbs. Flavors of pineapple and nectarine carry the palate, while the finish is quick and clean.

5362,Spain,"Butterscotch aromas are backed by a candied palate full of pear syrup. The mouthfeel is soft, and the finish everlasting due to residual sugar. Probably too sweet for most but not badly made. Imported by Freixenet USA.",83,9.0,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5369,Argentina,"Red in color, and definitely smelling and tasting like Malbec. And while you want to like it more, there are some glaring flaws here, namely a weak bead that turns it flat.

This is just the second release in the winery's two decade history. Though NV, it is based on the very ripe 1998 vintage. The winery's most elegant sparkling wine, it has a fine, textured mouthfeel and nicely nuanced flavors of pear, apple and light citrus.

5393,France,"Bready and round, and super attractive on the bouquet. Runs a bit crisp in the mouth, with orange and grapefruit flavors.

5394,US,"VML is one of the newest wineries in Sonoma County. They took over the site previously occupied by Belvedere, in the heart of the Middle Reach of the Russian River.

5395,France,"A yellow straw shade, with a somewhat beery, sulphury scent. It's better in the mouth, where it's spicy and yeasty. But the beery quality persists right through the finish. It leaves a slightly sour flavor long after being swallowed, like a bite of sourdough bread.",85,33.0,Champagne Blend,Vranken,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5396,Spain,"This a good Cava that delivers strawberry and raspberry aromas along with a raspy, scratchy side note.

5401,France,"This is a rich, maturing wine that is full of toasty, yeasty flavors that are finely integrated with the orange zest and apple flavors.

5402,France,"This blend of Chardonnay, with portions of the rare white grapes Arbane, Petit Meslier and Blanc Vrai, produces a wine that is richer than a blanc de blancs, with notes of crisp peach, pear and a hint of red fruit.

5407,Argentina,"Given the local competition, this Pinot Noir-dominated sparkler is pretty good.

5408,Spain,"Slightly low on kick and bubbles for a blanc de blancs, but the wine's mix of green herb, apple, green banana and melon flavors is good and offers the proper set up to a finish that's citrusy as can be and only slightly pithy. Seems a touch flat or it might have rated even higher.",87,18.0,Sparkling Blend,Paul Cheneau,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5416,Italy,"Here's a sparkling wine with all its many facets beautifully fitted together to form an incredibly seductive and inviting whole.

5426,Italy,"Often, extra dry Prosecco offers a deceptively sweet bouquet. Part of the reason for this is that smaller percentages of Chardonnay, Verdisio and Bianchetta have been added to the Prosecco blend.

5449,France,"With its bottle shape dating from the late 16th century, this is a traditionally made rosé, using color from macerating Pinot Noir grapes.

Imported by Laurent-Perrier.",90,60.0,Champagne Blend,Laurent-Perrier,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5450,France,"Mumm makes a mighty fine mid-priced bottle, with plenty of toasty flavor to lift it into an orbit close to where the big boys fly. The fruit is on the lighter side, but crisply defined, and it segues into the round, satisfying flavors of older, more mature Champagne. The bubbles are gentle and petite, and the flavors linger elegantly all around the tongue.",89,43.0,Champagne Blend,G. H. Mumm,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5453,US,"This is a rich, full-bodied and somewhat heavy rosé in its youth, brimming with warm California sunshine flavors of raspberries, strawberries, cherries and cola that have a slightly sweet finish.

5454,France,"Fragrant and deeply colored, I like the intensity of the flavors, which include dried herb, orange peel, citrus and pear. It's an interesting, somewhat offbeat wine—a more complex, more rustic and evolved style.",90,76.0,Champagne Blend,Pannier,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5455,Italy,"Redolent of cran-raspberry, peach, pink grapefruit and yeast, or fresh baked bread and butter. The acidity is fresh and crisp with medium to long persistency on the finish. Try is with finger food appetizers.",88,46.0,Sparkling Blend,Contadi Castaldi,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5456,France,"Devaux makes a yeasty, bubbly, straight-ahead style of Champagne. It's tart and tastes mostly of green apples, with just a faint hint of toast in the finish.

5458,US,"Royal Cuvée has turned into one of the most consistent buys in an upscale California bubbly, mainly due to the elegance that always marks the wine.

5468,France,"This starts out on the right foot, hitting you with a whiff of toasted nuts and crème caramel. The maturity of the blend seems well calculated; there's a very nice mix of crisp green fruit, spicy clove, and more mature, slightly oxidized, nutty flavors.

5474,Spain,"Slightly sweet on the nose, the aromas of baked fruit, cream soda and vanilla are welcoming.

5475,Italy,"The blend sees 90% Chardonnay and 10% Pinot Nero and the wine rests for 36 long months on the lees to produce an extremely creamy and inviting sparkler that is elegant and sophisticated yet genuine at the same time.

5484,US,"This shows the Schramsberg signature of elegance and symmetry—a sparkling wine with streamlined fanciness. Made from 100% Chardonnay, this is still pretty tight and austere, with a minerally hardness to the pear, citrus and yeast flavors.

5489,France,"There is great intensity to this finely crafted Champagne. It's rich and toasty, with flavors of ripe gooseberries and, in this example, some good bottle age.

5491,Australia,"Delicate and light-bodied with plenty to love in the nose, including irresistible notes of bread dough, strawberry and lemon which turn to fresh cherries in the mouth.

5494,France,"Moët's vintage, from the hot, low-yielding 2003 vintage, has an unusually high percentage of Pinot Meunier (43%), suggesting there is a distinct character to the year. It's certainly powerful and intense, soft initially, hinting at toast and yeast, the fruit almost sweet, even though the wine is a brut style. It is the rich strawberry flavor that's most surprising on a wine that really has integrated impressively.",93,65.0,Champagne Blend,Moët & Chandon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5500,France,"This is an elegant Champagne, with a burgeoning sense of maturity as well as fresh acidity.

5501,France,"Seductively light in color, this is based on Pinot Noir. It has a fine balance and a touch of toast. The fresh red-fruit and citrus flavors harmonize into a complex whole.

It's clean, lime-tinged and soda-like on the nose, with a correct, no-issues palate that pushes zesty apple along with sweet papaya, mango and banana flavors.

5505,Spain,"Grassy on the nose, and for a brut nature this is decidedly flat in aromas, with ultradry flavors of lime and tangerine along with powdery vanilla.

5507,France,"A very lean, dry style that focuses on its acidity and green fruits. This makes it a style that needs good bottle aging—the sample tasted was too young.

5514,France,"Really fine for a low-acid vintage, there's an intriguing nose here with white pepper, sandalwood and pine-nut elements.

5515,Spain,"As under-$10 sparklers go, you'd be hard-pressed to find better than this medium-bodied and toasty version from Catalonia's White Castle.

But who's complaining?",87,8.0,Sparkling Blend,Castellblanch,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5516,US,"This is Korbel's first-ever brut made with organic grapes. It's a solid sparkler, but not particularly better than any of their others. It shows rich flavors of citrus, vanilla and yeast, and is very tart in acidity.",85,16.0,Sparkling Blend,Korbel,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5517,France,"The 10% Pinot Noir in this otherwise Chardonnay-dominant blend adds an attractive, light pink color. It is crisp and fragrant. Pinot Noir's tannins barely show, while Chardonnay's apple-driven acidity comes through strongly.",89,67.0,Champagne Blend,Varnier Fannière,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5518,Italy,"Vanilla and pear aromas are neither exciting nor a turn-off, while the palate is solid, ifa bit tangy and weighty. Overall this is a modest wine that's on the downturn.

5519,France,"While the pretty pale salmon color is enough to draw anyone in, this sparkler delivers with delicate aromas of white raspberry, red apple flesh and broche.

5521,Spain,"Heat from the 2003 vintage aside, this is one sweet, forward, dark-colored Cava. The nose is all about cheeky, sweet fruit, while the palate offers more berry sweetness along with vanilla. Normally this bottling is more restrained and striated, but 2003 was a warm year. May be better with desserts than appetizers, given the ripeness.",87,18.0,Sparkling Blend,Llopart,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5522,US,"This is a special bottling with a fancy new label that commemorates Korbel's 130th anniversary. It's slightly sweet and easy to drink, with rich, creamy flavors of honey, orange and vanilla.

5533,US,"This sparkler is 100% Chardonnay and is clearly the star of the Domaine Ste. Michelle lineup. Generously toasty, with the sort of finesse found in Champagne.

5534,Spain,"Yeasty bready aromas are more smooth and leesy than fruity. This has a round palate that's full but not creamy due to firm acidity. Melon, peach and vanilla flavors finish yeasty and dry, with moderate complexity. This is made entirely from Pinot Noir.",90,25.0,Sparkling Blend,Parxet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5535,France,"Bold, vivacious and forward, this appealing wine is true to the house style, with plenty of sweet, pretty fruit. There are unchallenging but undeniably enjoyable flavors of ripe stone fruits, hints of grapefruit and citrus zest, and a smack of wet stone in the back of the throat. Young and fresh, without the toasty finesse of the vintage rosés.",88,50.0,Champagne Blend,Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5536,France,"Crisp, dry but fruity, this has just enough body to support the red currant flavors and crisp red-apple skin texture. A lively, vibrant wine, all freshness and light, just what a rosé should be.",90,40.0,Champagne Blend,Chanoine,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5537,South Africa,"A combination of creamy yeast and fresh strawberries on the nose gives this wine instant character. Fresh, clean citrus and mineral flavors touched with berry sweetness are balanced and elegant. Pair with poultry (chicken, hen, quail) dishes or grilled seafood.",89,18.0,Champagne Blend,Graham Beck,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5538,US,"Pale peach in color with savory aromas of apple, pear and buttered toast, this softly pétillant brut rosé hits the palate a touch sweet. Made from Pinot Noir with a splash of Chardonnay, it balances bracingly high acidity with rich, buttery biscuit flavors and a dry finish.",86,16.0,Sparkling Blend,Martha Clara,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5539,France,"Moët's style, with its delicious forward fruit, is well evidenced in this 1999 vintage. It is full bodied, with apple and almond flavors, developing a toasty character, but still retaining a ripe, open freshness.",92,52.0,Champagne Blend,Moët & Chandon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5540,US,"Made from Chardonnay and Pinot Gris, this is fine and delicate, with citrus, flower, vanilla, smoke and doughy yeast flavors that finish crisp and dry. Drink now.",87,26.0,Sparkling Blend,Mumm Napa,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5541,France,"Putting aside the chic lipstick pink bottle (and the pink plastic box it comes in), this is a pleasing, soft wine, with white fruit flavors which lend crisp point to the easy palate. It is certainly dry, but it is also relatively soft, a well thought out blend.",87,50.0,Champagne Blend,Pommery,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5542,Portugal,"With hints of minerality typical of any wine from the Dão, this has tight, yeasty notes that contrast with its crisp, bright apple fruit. Drink now.",85,11.0,Portuguese Sparkling,Global Wines,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5543,France,"The cooperative that makes Nicolas Feuillatte is doing good things with this brand. This Réserve Particulière is elegantly made, with fine white fruit flavors along with a touch of toast. It is light, poised and makes a good apéritif. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",88,28.0,Champagne Blend,Nicolas Feuillatte,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5544,Italy,"This is an intense and austere sparkling wine with persistent perlage and deep aromas of toast, roasted nut, honey, stone fruit and butterscotch. You'll also get a playful hint of chopped herbs that add buoyancy to the wine's thick, solid mouthfeel.",91,60.0,Sparkling Blend,Methius,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5545,France,"Creamy, fruity aromas already suggest a light, frothy wine. And that's just what this is, fulfilling all the specifications for a rosé. There's some of the 2000 vintage's acidity, and the wine floats across the mouth.",92,200.0,Champagne Blend,Taittinger,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5546,France,"Both citrus and apple notes are dulled by very earthy notes. The slender palate frothes softly but does not provide more fruit, either. This is dry and muted, but fresh.",84,21.0,Sparkling Blend,Pierre Sparr,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5547,France,"Considerable bottle aging shows with the nutty, toasty flavors of this wine. The fruit has gone, leaving structured maturity, somewhat austere, but a definite appeal to those who like older Champagne.",85,50.0,Champagne Blend,Vranken,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5548,France,"With evocative gold-painted Paris scenes decorating the bottle, this is obviously a because it works beautifully as a light, vivacious wine, with deliciously clean, not quite green, fruit. Imported by Duval-Leroy Imports.",90,35.0,Champagne Blend,Duval-Leroy,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5549,Spain,"Mild aromas of cherry and nectarine come across simple and sweet. Following the nose's lead, this is mellow on the palate, with raspberry and cherry flavors that are, once again, a bit sweet in character. A controlled, candied finish is consistent with what came before it.",88,25.0,Sparkling Blend,Llopart,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5550,US,"This lovely Mendocino sparkler, crafted from two-thirds Chardonnay and one-third Pinot Noir, has lilting apple and honey aromas buoyed by a thick head of mousse. There is a pleasing follow-through from aroma to flavor and a core of ripe apple. Dry, soft with a long finish, this is a hard-to-resist food-friendly wine ready to pair widely.",91,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Scharffenberger,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5551,US,"Not really pink, more of a salmon color, and quite sweet, with tangerine jelly and vanilla flavors. Good acidity and super-clean winemaking make it balanced and zesty.",84,11.0,Sparkling Blend,Barefoot Bubbly,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5552,France,"This new release from Mumm is a selection from 12 of the best vineyards owned or run by the company. It is certainly a complex wine, finely balanced with layers of intense, mature fruits, very mineral in structure, and with the crispness of the acidity acting as a support to the citrus and vanilla flavors. Worth aging for another 4–5 years.",93,140.0,Champagne Blend,G. H. Mumm,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5553,Spain,"There's something not right about the way this winery is fermenting its Cavas because both this and Oriol Rossell's regular brut are excessively foamy. As a result, this gran reserva's apple and spice aromas and flavors are rendered moot by the gaseous explosion that occurs when liquid hits palate.",80,27.0,Sparkling Blend,Oriol Rossell,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5554,France,"Not many rosé Champagnes have this vivid pink color. The taste is somewhat less exotic, with a good crisp feel to it, well textured with integrated acidity and red currant fruit. The aftertaste is soft, fresh.",86,40.0,Champagne Blend,Charles Orban,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5555,Spain,"Off dry, with green herbs and candy corn on the nose. Stays the course on the palate, with sweetness and just enough offsetting zest. Best for fans of sweet wines. Imported by Freixenet USA.",84,10.0,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5556,US,"Rich in strawberry, raspberry, vanilla and brown sugar flavors, this 100% Pinot Noir is delicate in texture, with brisk acidity. It's a good bubbly for drinking now.",84,39.0,Sparkling Blend,Collection 35,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5557,Spain,"Lemon, lime, apple and nectarine aromas are regular and clean. It feels good, citrusy and just round enough, with passion fruit, grapefruit and orange flavors. Tasty and fresh, this works well as a refresher.",87,13.0,Sparkling Blend,Bodegas Solo Privee,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5558,France,"The name means “timeless”, and this wine is a definite apéritif wine, maybe for when time matters little. It is soft but still crisp, layering attractive apple acidity over a creamy texture and a light, fresh aftertaste.",89,69.0,Champagne Blend,Mailly Grand Cru,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5559,France,"This is smooth, soft and seemingly sweet despite its brut designation. Strawberry and candied sugar notes combine with a lift of acidity.",83,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Le Grand Courtage,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5560,Spain,"Leesy aromas of tropical fruits feed into a flat palate. Leesy but bland peach and melon flavors lack conviction and finish sketchy, with nothing in particular standing out. This is the definition of a marginal Cava.",83,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Mont Paral,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5561,Spain,"Bready, stalky aromas run low on fruit while showing odd, unwelcome scents of peanut and sulfur. Gaseous, mealy flavors of yeasty citrus fruits finish heavy, with an oxidized quality.",83,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Clos La Soleya,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5562,France,"Offers an intriguing nose with ginger, lime and floral elements. The mouthfeel is ephemeral—almost too light—but there’s a good case to be made for this style when bubbles are involved. Green apple, an almost lilac note, and lime on the palate. Finishes nicely, too.",91,27.0,Champagne Blend,H.Germain,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5563,US,"This pretty, floral wine made entirely from Chardonnay grapes from this site is both creamy and crisp. It offers impressive length, acidity and stoniness, accenting its focused green apple flavor. As it opens, it takes on a richer honey-like tone that adds further complexity and deliciousness.",94,80.0,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5564,France,"Produced from vineyards in Ludes on the Montagne de Reims, this is a rich selection. A good proportion of Pinot Noir creates ripe notes of apple and black currant, laced with intense, crisp acidity. It will take 1–2 years of bottle aging.",91,70.0,Champagne Blend,Forget-Brimont,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5565,France,"Dry and crisp, this is a delicious rosé that has both ripe fruit and a tight line of acidity. Its red fruits are laced with fresh citrus character and an underlying touch of toast. This is a bottling that can improve with age, but is great now.",90,65.0,Champagne Blend,Lanson,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5566,Italy,"Part of a series of sparkling wines from Piera Martellozzo, this is a blend of Raboso and Pinot Nero. In fact, the wine's bright pink color comes from the former varietal and its delicate floral bouquet from the latter.",86,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Piera Martellozzo,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5567,US,"This lovely brut offers real Champagne-like finesse. It's rich and dry, with yeasty flavors of pineapples, lemon chiffon and raspberries. The mousse is creamy and smooth. This polished bubbly will develop with five years of cellaring.",90,19.0,Sparkling Blend,Scharffenberger,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5568,Lithuania,"Snappy aromas of citrus mingle with orange and honey on the nose of this sweet sparkling wine from Lithuania.  On the palate, the wine is rich and appealing, though perhaps a touch opulent for fans of drier wines. A great companion to Asian cuisine or paired up with an assortment of salty cheeses.",84,10.0,Sparkling Blend,Alita,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5569,US,"This is a frankly sweet sparkling wine, with sugary orange, lime, strawberry and vanilla flavors. If you like your bubblies with jammy sweetness, it's for you.",85,13.0,Sparkling Blend,Four Paws & A Tail,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5570,Italy,"This is a very attractive sparkling wine from Franciacorta, northern Italy, thanks to the sophistication of its aromas. You'll get buttery-yeasty notes backed by stone fruit and honeysuckle. It's easy drinking with bright acidity on the close.",89,35.0,Sparkling Blend,Tenuta Montedelma di Berardi,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5571,Australia,"Opens with a classic Shiraz nose of coconut, violets and tar that give way to raspberry and plum pudding notes couched in some woody tannins. The mousse is somewhere between coarse and fine while the medium finish shows just a bit of grip. A great choice to bring to a party.",87,18.0,Sparkling Blend,Hill of Content,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5572,Italy,"Made from organically grown grapes, this brut offers a floral and spice fragrance with a whiff of pastry. The creamy palate delivers ripe peach flavors and a note of almond. It has lively acidity and fine, persistent bubbles.",90,35.0,Sparkling Blend,Barone Pizzini,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5573,Italy,"Straightforward and easygoing, with pure apple and pear aromas. Sort of jumpy and youthful, with a fresh but foamy mouthfeel that is as much Sprite/7-Up as it is classic-method spumante. Forward apple and citrus flavors are clean and light, and if complexity is a bit lacking there's enough forward, tasty fruit to more than make up for it. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd.",89,54.0,Sparkling Blend,Bellavista,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5574,US,"This is a rich, robust bubbly. The palate is marked with honey-infused limes and Meyer lemons, with the bread dough sourness of lees. The mouthfeel is a little rough, though.",86,30.0,Sparkling Blend,Chandon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5575,France,"In an attempt to lighten the image of Champagne, Pommery has gone for a light style of wine and an equally light name, which harks back to the 1930s description of Champagne. Luckily, it is not all marketing, and the wine is good, with some bottle age, along with a poise and charm, which certainly works. Imported by W. J. Deutsch & Sons.",89,11.0,Champagne Blend,Pommery,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5576,Portugal,"A wine that is beginning to show its age, with yeast and toast dominating the fresh acidity and the broad, creamy character. It has a light texture, with a bite of steel to give the wine a final shape.",85,18.0,Portuguese Sparkling,Raposeira,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5577,US,"A toasty yeast note has taken center stage of this blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier, providing that uniquely Champagne-like accent to California's ripe strawberry, raspberry and lime flavors. Despite the ripe fruit flavors, the finish is dry and tart in acidity. It gets even better as it warms in the glass, displaying compelling complexities.",95,100.0,Sparkling Blend,Chandon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5578,France,"A full, somewhat sweet wine, fresh with foamy strawberries in the mouth. The acidity is missing somewhere, but this does make for a pleasing wine, certainly a fine partner to fresh fruits.",84,47.0,Champagne Blend,Charles Lafitte,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5579,Italy,"From the distant 2004 vintage, this pink and peach-colored sparkler offers yeasty tones of freshly baked bread and subtle notes of red berries and apricot. The wine is tonic and firm in the mouth with a creamy, foamy aftertaste. Beautiful and delicate.",92,60.0,Sparkling Blend,Ferrari,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5580,Spain,"Gold in color and short on bubbles, but heavy on sweetness and residual sugar. That said, it's an advertised semidry, so a certain level of cloy is expected. But this tips too far to the sweet side, leaving nothing but refined white sugar, banana and vanilla cream. Not my cup of tea.",82,9.0,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5581,Spain,"A classic cava from top to bottom. The nose offers familiar baked apple, mineral and saline aromas, while the palate is exceedingly fresh in its delivery of pineapple, apple and nectarine flavors. A fruity yet crisp number that foams up nicely on the palate but doesn't lose its focus or form.",89,12.0,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5582,US,"A sweetly delicious bubbly, with fine bubbles and a rich yeastiness to the citrus, cherry and vanilla flavors. The blend is of French Colombard, Chardonnay and Sangiovese.",86,16.0,Sparkling Blend,Korbel,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5583,France,"Very soft and open, this wine seems to be all froth and apples-and-cream flavors. It has a light touch of acidity, which comes through as the froth subsides.",88,49.0,Champagne Blend,Mailly Grand Cru,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5584,Italy,"Here's a pungent and intense Italian sparkler (made with Chardonnay, Pinot Bianco and Pinot Nero) that opens with bright aromas of apricot, mature melon, white almond and yellow rose.

5586,US,"From the pretty pale, amber color to the long, distinguished finish, this is a great rosé sparkler. To begin with, it's dry, a point in its favor, while the flavors are subtle and complex. They suggest pink grapefruits, tangerine zest, a squeeze of white peach, vanilla, and the smoke and dough of oak and lees. With its low alcohol and very low pH, it's a balanced wine of great structural integrity.",91,26.0,Sparkling Blend,Roederer Estate,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5587,US,"A little rough and scoury, but fine and crisp and clean, with a slight sweetness from the dosage enriching the citrus, apple, yeast and vanilla flavors. Fancy and elegant.",87,35.0,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5588,Spain,"The draw for Cristalino has always been its crispness, but this bottling seems more thick and savory, with ham-like aromas and bulky lemon, orange and pineapple flavors. When this used to be $6 and simple we were all over it; but this is soft and tastes like the fruit you get at a buffet breakfast.",83,10.0,Sparkling Blend,Cristalino,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5589,France,"A mature, toasty wine, perhaps too toasty. There are still hints of ripe strawberries as well as the more mature flavors. The wine shows a full-bodied character and an attractive onion skin color.",86,160.0,Champagne Blend,Vranken,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5590,US,"Based on Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, this luxe rosé bubbly is delicious to drink now. It's likeable for the array of strawberry, orange and lime flavors, with that savory sparkling wine yeastiness, and the bubbles are smooth and refined. Will set off many different foods, but sushi is a definite hit.",93,50.0,Sparkling Blend,Chandon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5594,France,"Creamy-textured in the mouth, this is an easy-to-drink bubbly that will satisfy the demands of any informal summer garden gathering. Flavors are of apples and pears, berries and cream; dry enough to serve with food, soft enough to serve on its own.",85,8.0,Sparkling Blend,Marquis de la Tour,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5595,France,"This full-bodied offering is ripe and richly balanced. A predominance of the two Pinots gives it an intense fruitiness, with raspberry and red apple notes dominating. At the same time, there is a fine, mineral-driven tautness that gives it a final, crisp bite. Disgorged February 2012.",88,56.0,Champagne Blend,H. Billiot Fils,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5596,Spain,"This leans a little green and soda-like on the nose, but it picks up clarity and speed on the palate, which carries a tangy, citric snap. It tastes of citrus and lees, and the finish is medium in length and healthy.",88,21.0,Sparkling Blend,Agustí Torelló Mata,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5597,US,"Bracingly effervescent bubbles offer aromas of baking soda, chalk and blood orange on this South Coast sparkler made from 82% Chardonnay and 18% Pinot Noir.

5599,France,"Gaston Chiquet's nonvintage offering features a toastiness that testifies to its bottle aging. Along with that feeling of richness, it also contains balanced acidity. Full, crisp and lively, the fresh and fruity aftertaste is delicious.",88,48.0,Champagne Blend,Gaston Chiquet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5600,Spain,"A mellow, neutral nose doesn't push the envelope. In the mouth, this is round but punchy, with some excess weight. Flavors of apple juice, pear and melon finish with flavors of lime, apple cider and powdered sugar.",84,10.0,Sparkling Blend,Tarantas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5601,France,"This is definitely dry, yet it still retains the full, rich Vilmart style. Crisp, mineral-driven and taut in character, it features a fine mélange of apple, tangerine, light spice and intense citrus. Its texture suggests it needs to age at least three more years.",91,93.0,Champagne Blend,Vilmart & Co,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5602,France,This sparkling wine is intense with startling acidity and very crisp citrus palate. Maybe a few months in bottle will soften it.,82,16.0,Sparkling Blend,Rieflé,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5603,France,"Pale pink in color, this is stylish rosé. It has the intense acidity of the 1996 vintage, meaning that it still tastes young, crisp, vibrant.

5604,US,"The main difference between this and Schramsberg's more expensive, vintage-dated brut is the texture. This feels a little more scouring, lacking the silky finesse. Made from equal parts Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.",88,25.0,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5610,Spain,"A dry and austere style is what you're looking at with Heredad.

Not much depth below the surface but definitely clean and flashy.",88,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5611,France,"A powerful, intense wine. The fruit is green and crisp, but the wine is full-bodied, with flavors of toast and almonds over ripe grapefruit and gooseberries. This wine is still very young, only just beginning to integrate the fruit and the acidity—give it 10 years.",92,65.0,Champagne Blend,Taittinger,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5612,US,"The scouring mouthfeel of this wine is its biggest issue. Although it's dryish and creamy, with pleasant flavors of dough, lime, orange and vanilla, its roughness limits its score.",85,25.0,Sparkling Blend,Biltmore,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5613,France,"Femme is Duval-Leroy's top cuvée. This, from the great 1996 vintage, is as much wine as sparkling experience.

5614,Italy,"A crystalline appearance is a preface for polished aromas of citrus, pineapple and tangerine. This is a fresh and fruity sparkler that stands out thanks to the zesty and cleansing impression it leaves in the mouth. An excellent match to neutral fatty foods such as ricotta-stuffed puff pastry, gratin dauphinoise or cheese soufflé. Imported by Paterno Wines International.",91,44.0,Sparkling Blend,Ca' del Bosco,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5615,Spain,"The color is an odd orange, which should come as an indicator that not all is right with this wine. The bouquet starts with dust on a warming radiator, and there's some vanilla as well.

5623,France,"The iconic Roederer Champagne, Cristal's latest release, brings a perfect balance of richness and age worthiness. It is full of apple flavor, and the mousse is very fine and almost imperceptible. As so often with a beautifully blended wine like this, a few minutes breathing brings out extra complex flavors. It certainly should age over five years and more.",97,249.0,Champagne Blend,Louis Roederer,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5624,France,"In a young, fresh style, this is full of white fruits, crisp acidity and pink grapefruit with a sugar touch. The aftertaste, though, is relatively soft, but still in balance with the rest of the flavors.",87,46.0,Champagne Blend,Chanoine,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5625,Spain,"Opening pastry aromas are a bit heavy, but the palate is solid and balanced, and the flavors of gooseberry, green herbs and apple work. This Cava has a mild green character to it once it hits the mouth, but it finishes dry, crisp and focused. 450 cases made.",87,23.0,Sparkling Blend,Can Vendrell,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5626,US,"A majority Pinot Noir (54%), this brut rosé has a healthy head of mousse followed by succulent strawberry flavor, bright acidity and a smooth finish. Dark golden-peach in color, it is layered and well-made, and a great value for the quality.",91,23.0,Sparkling Blend,Scharffenberger,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5627,US,"Ripe sour-cherry and red-berry notes on the nose and palate mingle elegantly with savory touches of burnt sugar and biscotti. It's dry in style, yet fruity and juicy, with brisk acidity and a tongue-tickling pétillance.",87,37.0,Sparkling Blend,Sparkling Pointe,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5628,Spain,"Apple and peach aromas come with a hint of lime. This is clean and feels good on the palate, where apple, peach and nectarine flavors lead to a straight-ahead finish that feels right but doesn't even suggest complexity.",87,14.0,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5629,Spain,"Mild comfortable aromas of burnt orange and spiced pumpkin lead to a tight, focused palate of moderate weight. Dry melon and peach aromas are on the money, while this finishes clean as polished glass, with a touch of spice.",91,38.0,Sparkling Blend,Alta Alella,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5630,US,"Made from native Cayuga grapes, this softly pétillant sparkler is pleasantly frothy, and features brisk, lemony acidity. Just a shade sweeter than brut, it's fruity and forward, with ample stone-fruit and blossom notes. Finishes with a dainty lacing of sugar. Drink now.",85,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Hosmer,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5631,US,"There's a sugary sweetness to this Pinot Noir and Chardonnay blend, in roughly equal measures. It's rich and ripe in raspberries, limes and oranges, with the doughy, leesy sourness that marks a good sparkling wine. Feels somewhat rough and aggressive now, but elegant and complex. Could develop bottle complexity over this decade.",90,70.0,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5632,France,"Toasty aromas follow through to a soft, creamy wine that has light acidity, ripeness and full Chardonnay flavors. This is a delicious, full-bodied wine, produced by a small family-owned firm in Le Mesnil sur Oger. Imported by Premier Wine & Spirits.",90,33.0,Champagne Blend,Philippe Gonet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5633,France,"Very opulent, from the ripeness of fruit in 1998, this still seems drier than other Moët vintages. It layers acidity with almost tropical flavors, tempered with a citrus element. The aftertaste is round, soft, and appealing.",90,52.0,Champagne Blend,Moët & Chandon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5634,Italy,"Delicate and light with a pale pink color and creamy white foam on the surface, this is a great little sparkling aperitivo wine to pair with spicy tapas or finger foods. Rose, raspberry and a touch of strawberry open the fragrant bouquet.",85,16.0,Sparkling Blend,Cleto Chiarli,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5635,Italy,"A pretty patchwork of delicate aromas such as grapefruit, white peach and crushed stone set the tone for a sparkler that delivers similar restraint and elegance in the mouth. It's fleshy and fresh, with a citrus and toasted nut finish. Imported by Remy Cointreau USA.",90,30.0,Sparkling Blend,Montenisa,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5636,US,"Wonderfully frothy in the glass, this round, rich sparkling wine smells sweetly of apple cider and buttered toast. This Pinot Noir/Chard blend has plenty of toasty, nutty flavors on the palate as well. Fresh apple and lemon notes make this a refreshing, uncomplicated sip with a pleasant walnut skin astringency on the finish.",86,40.0,Sparkling Blend,Wölffer,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5637,Spain,"Neutral yet clean, with pineapple and lemon-lime on both the nose and palate. Nothing out of the ordinary here. It's exactly as it has been for years: bubbly, a touch sweet and satisfying. Imported by Freixenet USA.",86,9.0,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5638,US,"This is Schramsberg's sweet sparkler, although it's not terribly sweet; it only suggests a touch of honeyed caramel cream, peach-vanilla frappuccino and gingerbread. Crisp acidity helps to balance. Made mainly from the rare Flora grape, which is a cross between Sémillon and Gewürztraminer.",87,38.0,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5639,France,"It's good that Pommery has given this wine some bottle age, despite the young image the label suggests. The result is dry, but with less fruit and more secondary toast and nut flavors, a finely textured wine. It also has some weight, which balances the acidity well.",89,50.0,Champagne Blend,Pommery,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5640,US,"The vintage was a great one not only for J's dry table wines but for its sparklers. This brut, a classic Chardonnay and Pinot blend, with a drop of Pinot Meunier, is dry, with complex lemon, orange, yeast, vanilla, cream and toast flavors. The bubbles are ultra-fine, raising the appeal.",92,48.0,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5641,US,"Dry and rather scoury, with a rough mouthfeel. But it's clean and bone dry, and shows proper sparkling wine flavors of citrus, vanilla, yeast and green apple.",86,19.0,Sparkling Blend,Francis Coppola,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5642,Spain,"If someone says Vilarnau brut, you should say, yes, I'd love a glass. This bubbly will win you over with its dense but controlled palate and flavors of orange and sweet, ripe grapefruit. It has a bit of green to it and it draws back nicely on the tongue without overfizzing.",88,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Vilarnau,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5643,US,"A beautiful sparkling wine that shows the Iron Horse signature of balanced elegance. The lime, raspberry, vanilla and brioche flavors are rich and intricate, but particularly lovely is the texture, which is soft and silky.",92,40.0,Sparkling Blend,Iron Horse,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5644,France,"One of the great nonvintage Champagnes, this is a wine with considerable bottle age, full of toasty flavors. With its gooseberry and apple fruit flavors, it is still fresh, but its great character comes from its supreme elegance. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",94,40.0,Champagne Blend,Pol Roger,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5645,Spain,"At first this is bready, and that's all. With airing, things turn more complex. In the mouth, this feels racy and firmly acidic, while flavors of citrus turn yeasty and malty with time. A long, layered, yeasty finish shows a slow pulse and not much zest.",89,37.0,Sparkling Blend,Maria Casanovas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5646,France,"This attractively balanced, ripe wine offers rich fruitiness and soft acidity, with apple, pear and greengage flavors.

5647,France,"With no dosage, this is a very dry wine that has benefited from some good bottle aging. It is also darker in color than some rosés, which gives the wine considerable body and richness. Imported by Remy Cointreau USA.",92,45.0,Champagne Blend,Piper-Heidsieck,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5648,France,An everyday sparkler with a nice toasted nuttiness mingling with solid and persistent baked green apple and citrus pith flavors. The mouth is creamy with fine carbonation and medium acidity. Drink now.,86,18.0,Sparkling Blend,Bourgeois Family,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5649,US,"Made from Pinot Noir, this is a dry, crisply elegant and full-bodied bubbly. You'll detect a sweetly ripe, mashed red cherry background to the yeast and vanilla flavors. Drink now through 2010.",90,28.0,Sparkling Blend,Laetitia,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5650,US,"Good flavors of citrus, peach, spice and toast in this classic blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier. It's dry, but rough in the mouth, with a scoury finish.",85,22.0,Sparkling Blend,Chandon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5652,France,"This single-vineyard Champagne is always at the summit in Champagne. The 1998 is just at the moment when the fresh fruits move into maturity. There is toast, almond and marzipan, while at the same time pink grapefruit crispness is still there. Drink it now for freshness; keep for many years for maturity.",95,225.0,Champagne Blend,Philipponnat,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5653,France,"Crisp, apple-flavored and touched by citrus, this is light and toasty. The finish is dry, fruity and fresh. Ready to drink.",84,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Le Grand Courtage,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5654,Spain,"Light citrus and a hint of baby powder is about all you get from the neutral nose. And seeing that it's a brut natural wine (meaning no dosage), you sort of expect it to have a clean, dry, tart character. Added notes of peach and green melon point it in the right direction, especially if you're not expecting any surprises along the way.",85,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Cava Blancher,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5655,France,"This Krug vintage is showing some maturity, especially from its toast aroma. But certainly not too much maturity, because on the palate the fruit remains young at heart, a crisp burst of freshness coming through the more mature acidity. All the elements are in balance, making a finely shaped wine, which impresses as much from its elegance as from its richness.",95,350.0,Champagne Blend,Krug,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5656,US,"Sparkling reds may never be a strong domestic category, but some uniquely compelling examples have recently turned up. This one shows juicy and tart red cherry, plum, cola and shiitake scents, delivered with a yeasty touch. The foamy palate brings forth red cherry, earth and sourdough flavors.",90,45.0,Sparkling Blend,Sevtap,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5657,US,"Good price for a bubbly of this quality. Shows a nice spectrum of citrus, yeast and strawberry flavors that finish dry, crisp and clean, if a little rough. Drink now.",85,17.0,Sparkling Blend,Piper Sonoma,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5659,France,"The vintage wines from Clicquot are consistently richer and fuller than either the nonvintage or La Grande Dame. Toast and custard scents, followed by youthful notes of apple and citrus. Long, even a bit tannic-feeling, on the finish. Arrives this December, but the price was not available at press time.",89,60.0,Champagne Blend,Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5660,France,"A light, frothy style of Champagne, fresh and crisp with a high proportion of Pinot Noir in the blend, giving quite tight acidity in the aftertaste. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",85,40.0,Champagne Blend,Nicolas Feuillatte,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5661,France,"This Pinot Noir-dominated wine is rich and structured with waves of acidity passing through the white currant, toast and a developing maturity. Extra richness comes from the oak fermentation, but, because of the low dosage, there is also an austerity and minerality about this wine that will find its best expression with food. Imported by Winebow.",95,90.0,Champagne Blend,Jacquesson et Fils,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5662,France,"Not many Grand Cru wines are made into a Sec style of Champagne. This wine is more soft than sweet, with plenty of acidity as well as a touch of honey. Soft and round at the end, the wine is balanced and ready to drink.",88,55.0,Champagne Blend,Jean Milan,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5663,France,"The beauty of Krug's rosé is the sense of bottle age, of that extra richness. That means the wine is not just the sum of its delicious red berry fruits. It's also the way the wine is rounded out, filled with secondary flavors, toast and almonds and a taut minerality. The aftertaste is taut, dry, seamless, complex.",94,400.0,Champagne Blend,Krug,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5664,France,"A delightful, light, strawberry wine. It has a bright, bubbly character and acidity that gives extra life to this classic apéritif wine. There is just a hint of softness from the fruit to finish.",87,24.0,Sparkling Blend,Bailly-Lapierre,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5665,France,"A soft product of a soft vintage, offering rich fruit as well as a crisp texture.

Age this excellent wine for 2–3 years.",91,75.0,Champagne Blend,Nicolas Feuillatte,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5666,US,"Much more robust and full-bodied than the L'Ermitage brut, but still elegant and fine. Offers yeast, smoke and vanilla-tinged strawberry flavors, in a slightly rugged texture. Age through the end of the decade.",93,72.0,Sparkling Blend,Roederer Estate,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5667,Italy,Encouraging aromas of bread dough and baked apple give way to a rubber note. Moderately flavorful in the mouth but somewhat mono-dimensional with a foamy mousse. Medium finish. Drink now.,84,24.0,Sparkling Blend,Banfi,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5668,France,"A big boy with almost fleshy fruit. The flavors push into exotic, tropical richness yet retain spicy citrus-rind highlights. There is nothing clumsy, despite the ripeness; the finish seems to extend almost infinitely and keeps zinging you with surprises—marshmallow, marzipan, cookie dough, etc. An added bonus: the back label clearly indicates when it was bottled and cellared (2001).",94,36.0,Champagne Blend,Charles Heidsieck,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5669,Spain,"This Cava has a funky nose that's unusual. The palate is a bit flabby, with sweet banana and peachy flavors. There's not much to the finish and overall this comes across as overly simple and strained.",83,13.0,Sparkling Blend,Paul Cheneau,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5670,France,"Full and fat mousse over peachy fruit, acidity and an earthy character. This sparkling wine from Provence finishes with some crushed strawberry sweetness.",83,17.0,Sparkling Blend,Domaine du Grand Cros,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5673,Spain,"This is a little wayward and funky on the nose, with a lightly pickled aroma. It's a forward Cava with a yeasty, creamy feel. Its acidity and proper bubbles set up flavors of pastry, powdered sugar and sweet apple. The finish is quick, ending with a white-pepper flavor.",87,16.0,Sparkling Blend,Agustí Torelló Mata,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5674,US,"A blend of Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier, this is a rich, slightly sweet bubbly. It has ripe, delicious flavors of raspberry jam, cherry pie, vanilla, yeasty sourdough and buttercream. It's a little rough in texture, but a nice wine for drinking now.",88,30.0,Sparkling Blend,PLR Legacy,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5675,France,"An enticing, sophisticated wine. While it is fresh, with great floral aromas and flavors, it also shows hints of maturity, with toast just beginning to float over the yeast and grapefruit flavors. The aftertaste is very dry, crisp.",90,46.0,Champagne Blend,Chanoine,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5676,US,"A brilliant brut, comprised of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. It displays the qualities of dryness and yeastiness, with complex flavors of limes, vanilla and a touch of raspberry. The mousse is very fine, while the acidity is extraordinarily clean and brisk. Beautiful now, and should age for many years.",95,70.0,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5677,Italy,"There's good aromatic intensity here in the form of peach, sourdough, yellow rose and honey-roasted almond.

5678,Spain,"Starts out with stalky, corny aromas that are typical of sweet Cavas. It feels candied and almost cloying, but adequate acidity comes to the rescue. Flavors of melon, mango and kiwi are sweet, while the finish suggests corn cakes and tropical fruits.",85,14.0,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5679,Italy,"This rosé opens with a floral and fruity fragrance of orange blossom and strawberry. The palate delivers white cherry, creamy berry, Alpine herb, clove and cinnamon notes. The wine is fresh and elegantly sparkling.",89,30.0,Sparkling Blend,Cola,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5680,France,"Aged in wood before bottling, this is ripe and very full. Rather than add to the already-complex flavors, the wood has rounded it out. Yellow fruit integrates with intense, mineral-driven acidity, which accentuates the richness of this impressive bottling. Disgorged June 2012.",92,90.0,Champagne Blend,H. Billiot Fils,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5681,US,"Almost as pale as a brut, with a touch of salmon color, and deeply flavored, this Chardonnay and Pinot Noir blend has subtle, inviting flavors of cherries, strawberries, orange zest, vanilla and freshly baked brioche.

5682,France,"A fruit-driven wine, with aromas of dried apples, pineapple and citrus, even a bit of honey. Flavors verge on tropical, but it boasts a creamy texture and a crisp, dry finish.

5685,Argentina,"A little sweet on the nose, with powdered sugar, vanilla and white fruit aromas. Feels foamy but just fresh enough, with apple, melon and controlled stalky flavors.

5686,France,"Opens with a stunning layered, bouquet of dried fruits, sandalwood, flowers, smoke and ginger. It's full on the tongue, with rich pear and apple flavors, toast and yeast accents.

Sourced from seven grand cru villages, this is superb now and will last a very long time.",95,185.0,Champagne Blend,Bruno Paillard,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5687,France,"This richly textured wine boasts incredible freshness, as well as complexity of flavor. Apple and citrus flavors show hints of development— secondary notes of toast and cookies.

5689,England,"This wine resonates earth, apple, chalk and oatmeal with purity and poise, yet is less about fruit and more about structure and elegance. The balance here is astounding: autolysis subsumes acidity and turns it into a luminous, resonant, cool glow. Restrained elegance and subtle balance are central themes—the finish is long, subtle and creamy.",92,50.0,Sparkling Blend,Ridgeview Estate,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5690,Italy,"Sweet notes of peppermint, exotic green herbs and yellow fruit come forward on the nose of this 80/20 sparkling blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Nero.

5702,Hungary,"A very pretty, opulent floral nose with hints of spice lead on this Hungarian sparkler. On the palate, it has a clean, minerally flavor that lacks some of the dimension and finesse that the nose would lead one to expect. A good food wine, though—and fun. Imported by MHW Ltd.",83,10.0,Sparkling Blend,Törley,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5703,France,"A light, soft style with fresh, sweet apples and a touch of caramel. This is an easy style of wine, finishing off dry.",83,13.0,Sparkling Blend,Kriter,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

Give it a few years for the edges to smooth out.",90,36.0,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5709,France,"With zero dosage, this is obviously a very dry Champagne. But such is the richness of its fruit that it tastes ripe and rounded, allowing the citrus bite to fit well with the apple skin flavor. It could age a year.",91,56.0,Champagne Blend,Billecart-Salmon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5710,Australia,"Elegant and a bit reticent. Citrus, toast and strawberry fruit gradually emerge on the nose, paving the way for sour apple and lemon character in the mouth. The fine mousse has good persistence. Crisp, then turns almost tart on the medium finish. Can be drunk now but the razor-like acidity will soften with two to three years aging.",87,25.0,Sparkling Blend,Yarrabank,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5711,Spain,"This has a scent of baked apple, and in the mouth, it seems just as much a still white wine as a Cava, with a soft bead that indicates that it's starting to lose steam.

5743,France,"With a majority of Chardonnay in the blend, this has turned into a wonderfully expressive wine.

5749,France,"A coconut streak stands out immediately, then there's a vertical wall of stone, citrus and licorice.

5765,Spain,"Mineral, citrus and dusty aromas are textbook for brut Cava. A round, full palate shows good grip and acidity, while flavors of lemon-lime and nectarine finish with notes of lime and green banana.

5768,Spain,"Regal in presentation, with its faux-metal label and broad-based bottle. And in every edition it's one of Spain's more elegant, serious cavas.

Imported by Freixnet USA.",89,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5769,France,"A mature, soft wine, with good acidity and a fine, toasty character. It has good bottle age and a creamy, almond-flavored character. A delicious wine, just showing its origin by being richer than many Champagnes.",89,25.0,Champagne Blend,Simonnet-Febvre,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5770,US,"Faded yellowish pink in color, this bottling by vintner Richard Sanford and winemaker Nick de Luca shows baking soda, squeezed lemon, sour raspberry and a touch of maraschino cherry on the nose.

5775,Australia,"The winery's cellar door markets this sparkler's name on various clothing items (including a man's shirt that says ""Nothing goes down like a Vixen""); if you know an appropriately saucy woman, break open this bubbly. Aromas are inky, and perhaps a little salty, wtih dark plum and ink flavors. Bead is a little coarse at palate entry but softens up soon after. A blend of Shiraz (55%), Cab Franc (30%) and Cab Sauvignon (15%), made nonvintage each year in a solera-like system.",88,17.0,Sparkling Blend,Fox Creek,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5776,France,"The color alone sets this wine apart from its peers; it's what can only be called Barbie doll pink.

5781,France,"This is Piper's style of making extra dry wines. Its pale raspberry color suggests a  party wine, but to taste it is more raw than pretty, with high acids and light green flavors.

5784,US,"Though nonvintage, 100% of the half Chardonnay and half Pinot Noir grapes in this sparkling blend hail from 2009, a nice vintage for Mendocino.

5785,France,"This soft and slightly green sparkler has redeeming mild spice notes.  The bouquet's hint of anise and tarragon add interest, and the even, smooth palate shows more licorice notes and even light feel with a soft mousse.  Green herbs show on the finish of this easy drinker.",84,9.0,Champagne Blend,Kriter,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5788,France,"This is styled in a relatively mature, slightly oxidized fashion. It's round and full-bodied, with lots of oily, buttered-nut flavors.

5791,France,"Although the aromas are toasty, the flavors are still so fresh, rich, complex. This is a wonderful expression of taut minerality, pure citrus zest and then a wood-toast character that gives the wine both richness and sophistication.

5797,France,"This is a blend from Aÿ on the Montagne de Reims and from the Côte des Blancs. It is intensely perfumed, with weight from Pinot Noir and crispness from Chardonnay.

5798,Spain,"We've tried this nonvintage brut cava for three years running, and it has registered similarly each time.

5804,US,"This tastes a little sweet and a little scouring, but it's a nice everyday bubbly. With a creamy, yeasty flavor, it offers pleasant pear, orange and vanilla notes.",87,15.0,Sparkling Blend,One Hope,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5805,France,"Selected from the eight grand cru villages in which Madame owned vineyards, this lean, youthful wine is delicious now but could use additional bottle age to broaden out.

5809,US,"The producer's flagship high-end sparkler starts with 52% Pinot Noir, adding in 48% Chardonnay, a touch of residual sugar (10 g/L) and 44 months in bottle. Peach and cherry take on candied flavors in the glass, adding an opulence to the leaner notes of tart orange and grapefruit. Round and smooth on the palate, it's enjoyable now.",91,70.0,Sparkling Blend,Mumm Napa,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5810,Spain,"After many years of showing well, this rendition of Arias has some vinegar and sour apple on the nose and palate. There's also a full and ripe body, pretty good mouthfeel, and then persistence on the finish. Seems strained.",83,14.0,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5812,US,"This is a sweet, simple sparkling wine made from 60% Chenin Blanc and 40% Chardonnay. It has a lemon/citrus nose, with some soapy scents that carry through in the flavor. The big bubbles and sugary mouthfeel suggest that it was made by the charmat process; in any event, it's a bubbly best suited for mixing with orange juice or something tart like cranberry juice, and served as a Sunday morning spirit-lifter.",81,8.0,Champagne Blend,Ste. Chapelle,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

In addition, it's a little more pricey than the competition.",87,17.0,Sparkling Blend,Gran Rigau,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5816,France,"Almost bone dry, this Champagne can be difficult to appreciate, layered with acidity and green fruit. But get beneath its dryness and the fruit is surprisingly ripe, with pink grapefruit flavors.

5817,US,"Made in a Méthode Champenoise style from well-farmed vineyards, this Blanc de Blancs is sharp in acidity and biting flavors of green apple and lemon zest.

5835,France,"This is a powerful, almost concentrated, very dry selection. Its richness comes from the weight of its fruit flavors and the tight tang of its intense acidity.

The 2000 is about 50-50 Chardonnay and Pinot, and is very rich and flavorful in yeast, smoke, strawberry, citrus and vanilla flavors, but it's also a very young wine, tight and minerally.

It does need a few more months' bottle age to lose its complete emphasis on acidity.",87,18.0,Sparkling Blend,Château Moncontour,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5893,US,"A pretty good sparkling wine, made from classic varieties. It's a little scoury and sweet, but nice and crisp, with tangerine, raspberry, yeast and toast flavors.",86,30.0,Sparkling Blend,Vertuze,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5894,US,"There a lot of complexity on the palate of this dryish brut, with flavors of limes, raspberries, yeast, toast and vanilla. It's a tad scoury in the mouth, with a sandpapery roughness. Not an ager, so drink up.",87,45.0,Sparkling Blend,Chandon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5895,Argentina,"Upon nosing, it's sharp, funky and makes your eyes water. Feels foamy and unruly, with nectarine flavors muddled by a pithy bitterness. Finishes with a decent feel and touches of peach and other stone fruits.",81,16.0,Sparkling Blend,High Desert,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5896,Spain,"This smells yeasty and toasty/smoky, with mild white-fruit scents. For the most part, the palate feels clean and fresh, while papaya, white peach and melon flavors finish with sweetness.",85,9.0,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5897,US,"Coconut and golden apple, hazelnut and pastry crust notes mark the nose. Light to medium in body, the palate feels taut and linear, with a slightly raspy bead.

5898,US,"Thickly moussed, Roederer's Brut, 60% Chardonnay blended with 40% Pinot Noir, aged two years on yeast is affordable and luxurious.

5900,US,"This is an unusual mix of disparate flavors—some spice, some mint, eucalyptus, lemon, pineapple—all with a rather bitter edge. It falls apart on the finish, with a chemical, paint thinner aftertaste.",82,25.0,Sparkling Blend,Gresser,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5901,US,"This is the winery's most expensive bottling, a late disgorged bubbly that has now seen a decade of age. It shows the elegant polish of the '97 Royal Cuvée, but is superior even to it in richness. The creamy smoothness is the star attraction, but so are the subtle citrus, raspberry, brioche and vanilla flavors. Impeccably dry balance guarantees that this beautiful brut will age effortlessly for 10 years, if not longer.",95,50.0,Sparkling Blend,Gloria Ferrer,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5902,US,"The bubbles are a little scoury on this delightfully dry rosé, which makes it feel rough in the mouth. Aside from that, it's rich and complex in orange, strawberry, vanilla and yeasty flavors.",87,28.0,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

There is weight, and great acidity on the finish.",90,65.0,Champagne Blend,Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5905,New Zealand,"This sparkling blend of 65% Chard and 35% Pinot spends a minimum of 42 months on the lees prior to disgorgement, giving it a toasty, autolytic bouquet that marries well with the crisp, clean, lemony flavors. Verging on austere, but in a mouthwatering way. Try as an apéritif. Imported by Sauvage Selections.",90,28.0,Sparkling Blend,Quartz Reef,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5906,Italy,"There's a warm, yeasty quality to this bright sparkling blend (with Chardonnay and Pinot Nero) from northern Italy.

5907,France,"Ripe and forward, with a bit of sweetness in the form of root beer and nutmeg. The palate is equally ripe, as it shows melon and red-apple flavors.

5908,France,"Egarade means a “mysterious evening stroll,” according to the producer. Perhaps the idea is that you lose track of time in this wine. A blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, it is rich and full-bodied with a good weight of white and green fruits and a final nervy texture and acidity.",92,26.0,Champagne Blend,Bailly-Lapierre,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5909,Spain,"A round, cidery, gaseous nose includes sulfuric notes and yeasty, bready accents. This runs soft on bubbles and feels a lot like Sprite or 7-Up. Lemon-lime core flavors are monotone, while grassy green-apple flavors take over on the finish.",85,16.0,Sparkling Blend,La Crusset,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5913,France,"This is a heavy, rather clumsy wine, that seems to be too soft. The weight shows through the almonds and green plum fruits, while the acidity seems somewhat forced. To finish, the softness returns. Bottle age may help this wine to liven up.",88,140.0,Champagne Blend,Perrier Jouët,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5914,France,"Some bottle age gives a toasty character to the ripe fruit and lively acidity, adding extra complexity to this rich wine. The citrus and apple acidity are woven together in a tight, mature structure.",90,50.0,Champagne Blend,Charles Ellner,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5915,US,"DVX is Mumm Napa's top of the line vintage bottling. This '02 is a 50-50 blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, making it a brut. It's very high in acidity, and the bubbles are tiny and refined, giving it the ultra-smooth mouthfeel you want in a superior sparkling wine. The raspberry, lime and pear flavors are rich, but subtle, reined in by yeastiness and a tangy minerality. Drink this luxurious bubbly now and over the next 10 years.",94,55.0,Sparkling Blend,Mumm Napa,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5916,France,"Although the producer is based in the Loire, it sources grapes for this wine from other regions of France as well as locally. That gives the wine perhaps a richer, softer, less fresh character. It is an easy, apple-fruity wine with light acidity.",85,12.0,Sparkling Blend,Monmousseau,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5924,France,"For those who like their non-vintage with some bottle age, this is a fine wine.

5925,Spain,"This is as crisp and dry as a whispy reed, with a mild grassy note on the nose. It feels fresh and focused, with lime, peach and apple flavors.

5927,Spain,"Red in color, with aromas of raspberry, cherry Lifesavers and not much else. The mouthfeel is solid, while the red-fruit flavors are light, innocuous and hint at plums and apple skins. Short and wet on the finish, with a residual raspberry flavor.",84,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Roger Goulart,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5928,Spain,"Gold in color, this Cava displays a distinct aroma of arugula or lettuce along with cream soda. It's foamy and soft on the palate, with a mix of bitter, toasty flavors as well as baked apple. Yeasty tasting yet bitter on the finish. Tasted twice; this reflects the better of two samples.",83,29.0,Sparkling Blend,Dominio de la Vega,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5930,France,"Highly acidic Champagne, although also with some final sweetness. The wine is dominated by intense citric flavors, giving a mouth-puckering character. A year's bottle age might help.",85,35.0,Champagne Blend,G.H. Martel,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5931,US,"Mirabelle is akin to Schramsberg's second label, but this brut is pretty good. Made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, it's rich and scoury with flavors of oranges, strawberries, limes and vanilla.",86,25.0,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5932,US,"Quite a success, and a good price for a sparkling wine of this elegance. The Pinot Noir contributes a full-bodied richness, with suggestions of cherries, while Chardonnay provides elegance and citrusy acidity. The mousse is very fine and silky. Should develop in the bottle over the next six years.",92,30.0,Sparkling Blend,Mumm Napa,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5933,France,"A tour de force from this cooperative, whose vines are concentrated in the grand cru vineyards of Mailly.

5935,New Zealand,"Rich, buttery and brioche-like on the nose, this is a relatively full-bodied sparkling wine with tons of personality. It's toasty and buttery, like a fine pastry, without being excessively heavy, and has a lingering finish.",90,48.0,Sparkling Blend,Huia,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5936,Australia,"A terrific value in sparkling wine, this slightly copper-tinged bubbly features classy aromas of dried thyme, citrus and apple.

5938,France,"As it develops in bottle, this wine retains all its intense acidity. But it has now brought in a toast and yeast character that gives it even greater complexity.

5940,US,"Chalky minerality meshes with soft, clean and crisp pink grapefruit flesh and blossom on the nose of this wine by Norm Yost, one of the first to make sparklers annually in Santa Barbara.

5941,US,"Right up there with the recent string of fabulous têtes de cuvées, the 2000 shows the concentration, power and subtlety of this, the winery's top release. A blend of Chardonnay with 20% Pinot Noir, it shows exotic and complex flavors of tangerines and raspberries, candied ginger, coconut macaroons, baked bread and yeast. It's delicious now, but all the parts haven't come together. Hold until mid-2008 through 2010, but could go well beyond that.",94,90.0,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

5943,US,"Made entirely from Chardonnay, it shows real delicacy and richness, with a mousse as smooth as fine satin.

5945,France,"While 2000 was not a great vintage, Roederer manages to make a fine wine out of it: dry but ripe, crisp but also full-bodied, a pure line of green fruits open with a burst in the mouth. To finish, there are hints of things to come; age 5 years and more.",94,72.0,Champagne Blend,Louis Roederer,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5946,Spain,"With its citrusy nose and well-balanced palate, this is what Best Buy sparklers are all about.

5948,Spain,"Subtle aromas of white fruits, talc and powdered sugar are totally what they should be given that this is an extra dry Cava.

5949,US,"Iron Horse crafted this brut, which has a gorgeous red and yellow label, for the Chinese market. It's similar to their other bruts, dry and rich in lime, strawberry and yeasty flavors, although it's softer, which may reflect what Iron Horse knows about the Chinese palate.

5955,France,"Philipponnat's 1522 cuvée is a reference to the date of the first record of Philipponnat as grape growers in Ay.

5957,France,"A pretty, salmon-colored wine, it starts off with scents of strawberry, hay and earth, with just a whiff of cinnamon spice as well.

5983,France,"Tasted from a magnum disgorged in '97, this provides ample evidence that '85 was a great year for Clicquot. Toasty, but seems less evolved than the '85 Brut, with a deep copper color, meaty, savory aromas, berry flavors and a full, creamy texture. Long on the finish. It's made from the same base as the '85 Brut, but with 14.5% red from Bouzy added.",93,250.0,Champagne Blend,Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5984,France,"The richer vintage wines from Boizel are often best with food. This 1998, a blend of 55% Pinot Noir and 45% Chardonnay, has the right combination of creaminess and richness along with flavors of raspberries and fresh acidity. Imported by Winebow.",91,35.0,Champagne Blend,Boizel,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5985,Austria,"A ripe, full and balanced sparkling wine, this shows the right amount of maturity, displaying hints of toast and yeast and flavors of apple and lemon. It could age for another few years, but it is ready to drink now.",90,44.0,Sparkling Blend,Bründlmayer,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5986,France,"A lighter style, with a creamy texture and a crisp, youthful feel. Lemon and toast dominate, but there's a deep apple and mineral core lurking below. Imported by Remy Cointreau USA.",90,65.0,Champagne Blend,Charles Heidsieck,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5987,France,"While this is a nonvintage wine, it is still very young and will benefit from time in bottle. That will allow the rich apple and crisp lemon flavors to round out, calming the intense acidity. The potential of this rich wine is considerable.",90,30.0,Sparkling Blend,Domaine Charles Baur,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5988,US,"This is the driest of Iron Horse's new releases, but it still has a honeyed richness even though the residual sugar is a comparatively low half a percent.

5993,Italy,"This Brut Franciacorta boasts a bright, golden color with intense aromas of spice, white pepper, toasted nut, butterscotch and caramel.

5994,Spain,"Creamy and yeasty, with mild apple and bread-based aromas. Nice in the mouth, with citrus leading the way. Shows ample kick and acidity, with length and balance on the finish. Perfectly good overall, if not overly exciting. Imported by Bon Vivant Imports.",87,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Castellroig,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5995,US,"A gorgeous, Champagne-like sparkling wine. As good as the 2000, it's rich and silky, with a very fine mousse and rich citrus and yeast flavors. Needs time. Give it at least five or six years in the bottle, if you can keep your hands off.",94,55.0,Sparkling Blend,Mumm Napa,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
5996,Spain,"Applesauce aromas are open and inoffensive, and the palate is wet and refreshing, with crisp, dry green apple and generic white fruit flavors.

6001,Spain,"Full and heavy, with mango and orange juice flavors. Creamy in the mouth, with a full, foamy feel.

6003,Spain,"Crisp as it should be, with fit aromas of apple, fresh lettuce and honey. The palate is crystal clear in its delivery of lemon, apple and green banana, while the finish is vivacious and runs the distance. Quite satisfying and fairly serious given its under-$15 provenance.",88,14.0,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6004,France,"Clean and fresh with lively citrus rind and red apple flesh aromas and flavors. It's not overdone and quite drinkable, with a soft toastiness that lingers through the finish. The texture is creamy and the swallow crisp.",87,21.0,Champagne Blend,Les Jamelles,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6005,Spain,"Keeps the Cordon Negro reputation healthy by delivering easygoing lemon-lime aromas and round citrus and apple flavors. As correct as one can ask for, this large-production cava features pure-fruit character and a perfectly good mouthfeel. For the money, we give it the proverbial high-five.",88,10.0,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6006,France,"From the lesser-quality 2006 vintage, this is a gentle and tangy selection. It has lemon zest and steely acidity, with light touches of grapefruit and crisp apple. Not for aging, this is an attractive wine to drink now.",87,220.0,Champagne Blend,Michel Moritz,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6007,Spain,"Reddish in color and devoid of a visible bubble bead, this Garnacha-Monastrell cava is lacking in many ways. The nose is grassy and ashy, sort of like a spent cigar, and it's cheesy as well. In the mouth, it's fairly bland tasting, with generic, semitart flavors and a sharp finish.",82,13.0,Sparkling Blend,Cavas Hill,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6008,Spain,"Contrary to the fresher and more focused 2009 Brut Nature from Sonim, this bubbly shows stalky corn and acrid aromas along with apple and green herb notes. There's some elegance to the palate but overall it's tart and limited, with strong citric acids and only a hint of yeasty stuffing.",85,29.0,Sparkling Blend,Sonim,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6009,France,"From start to finish, this top quality vintage follows a straight line. It starts with freshness and explodes into richness. The initial very tight structure soon opens out with white pears and green plums, soft and ripe. The fruit is supported by the structure which offers orange zest. Like many 1999s, this is almost ready to drink.",93,103.0,Champagne Blend,Pol Roger,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6010,Spain,"Flowery and sweet smelling, then round and fairly smooth in the mouth. The bubbles and flavor package of tropical fruits galore is pleasant and shouldn't offend anyone. Finishes clean and easy. A mango boat of flavor.",85,8.0,Sparkling Blend,J. Garcia Carrion,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6011,US,"Extra brut means that this Pinot Noir-based bubbly is drier than Schramsberg's regular brut. Even at the age of more than seven years, it's aggressive in bubbly acidity, with a scoury mouthfeel framing ripe raspberry and lime flavors. Feels austere and hard, but who knows? Could surprise. A gamble if you want to cellar it.",89,70.0,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6012,France,"A glorious Champagne, now at the peak of its powers and maturity. It is rich, creamy, lightly toasty, cookies and yeast propelling the fruits and acidity forward into a wonderful texture. This wine confirms Henriot's place at the top tables of Champagne.",98,170.0,Champagne Blend,Henriot,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

6014,Spain,"Neutral for the most part, with a touch of toasty wheat and baked apple on the nose. Typical cava petrol invades the palate, but it's overrun by tastier, fresher apple and banana flavors. Exhibits some light toastiness on the finish. Imported by CIV/USA.",86,9.0,Sparkling Blend,Cristalino,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6015,France,"Shines with elegance and class right from the start of the toasty, yeasty, appley bouquet with vanilla hints.

A great example of how far wines designated Kosher have come, and what is possible in this category.",91,40.0,Champagne Blend,Laurent-Perrier,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6016,Italy,"This sparkling wine offers sweet floral aromas of peach blossom and white cherry. The frothy palate delivers creamy lemon and apple flavors, that finish dry, with a note of bitter almond. Pair it with shellfish or enjoy as an apéritif.",89,36.0,Sparkling Blend,La Valle,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6017,Argentina,"Sweet from the start, with maple and pear on the bouquet. More soft than sturdy, with a candied palate that offers round, almost sugary citrus flavors. Easy for a glass or two, but without the voltage to go further.",85,13.0,Sparkling Blend,Santa Julia,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6018,France,"With a fine sense of maturity, this is rich, toasty, full-bodied and concentrated. It is a Champagne with weight, showing pink grapefruit, melon and green plum flavors inside an intense texture. At the end, acidity combines with a fine toasty flourish.",92,55.0,Champagne Blend,Lallier,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6019,Italy,"Feminine and delicate, this has pretty highlights of peach, citrus, white almond and toasted bread. It feels creamy and generous, with tonic, firm effervescence.",90,40.0,Sparkling Blend,Villa,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6020,US,"This is a fun discovery, a tantalizing mix of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay grown from estate vineyards in cool, acid-driven sites within the appellation ideal for sparkling.

6021,Italy,"Made from Chardonnay with 5% Pinot Nero, this festive sparkler delivers Golden Delicious apple, roasted nut, water chestnut, banana and a slight note of green grass. Clearly etched and polished in the mouth, with a slightly hefty body. Imported by Selected Estates of Europe Ltd.     Note:  Not sure if this is the same Berlucchi as Fratelli Berlucchi or Guido Berlucchi. Must check with importer.",89,32.0,Sparkling Blend,Berlucchi,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

6023,Spain,"Aromas of waffles and corn flakes suggest maturity and complexity. This feels open and wide, with depth to the palate.

6024,France,"There is a skill to making an off-dry Champagne, blending sweetness and the fresh, lively character. This wine doesn't quite make it. The two elements—fruit and sweetness—are not integrated and leave a candied character.",83,63.0,Champagne Blend,Bertrand-Delespierre,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6025,US,"First made for the historic summits between Reagan and Gorbachev in 1985, this blend of 69% Pinot Noir and 31% Chardonnay marks the 30th anniversary of that event.

6026,France,"Ayala, based in Aÿ in the heart of Champagne, has been transformed since Bollinger bought it in 2005 and this nonvintage proves it. This is a balanced blend of 40% Chardonnay, 40% Pinot Noir and 20% Pinot Meunier. The result is crisp while not too dry, and therefore drinkable as an apéritif. Apple and bright citrus combine with green plums to give a fruity wine that is also structured. The cellarmaster continues to reduce the dosage (sugar) so there is a crisp, tight aftertaste.",90,50.0,Champagne Blend,Ayala,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6027,Georgia,"This non-vintage Brut is straightforward with its citrus aromas and flavors, creamy mousse and slightly off-dry character (the name is a bit misleading). A fun everyday sparkler that will pair well with desserts and fruit.",82,13.0,Sparkling Blend,Bagrationi 1882,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6028,Spain,"Golden in color, this has bready baked-apple aromas. It feels plump and soft for a brut nature, with a maderized quality to the palate. It tastes extremely dry, like seltzer water blended with citrus, almond and butterscotch. It continues on the same flavor plane throughout the finish.",85,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Jaume Serra,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6029,France,"The main nonvintage wine from Veuve Doussot is soft, creamy with plenty of ripe, fresh fruits. Pears and apricots come to the fore and are attractively cut by the lime acidity. Around this fruit, there's good mineral tightness and finishing acidity.",88,45.0,Champagne Blend,Veuve Doussot,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6030,Italy,"This elegant sparkling wine has a subdued fragrance that reveals delicate floral and nut aromas. The palate is more expressive, offering citrus, tropical fruit and roasted almond flavors. The pleasant foamy texture is accompanied by lively acidity.",89,28.0,Sparkling Blend,Antica Fratta,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6031,US,"Chardonnay in this sparkler, and it shows in the fresh peach and Meyer lemon flavors. The wine is a little softer in acidity than Korbel's other bubblies, and also a little sweet, which makes it somewhat cloying.",84,12.0,Sparkling Blend,Korbel,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6032,France,"Very soft, gentle Champagne, showing definite signs of a sweet dosage, with its flavors of brown sugar, baked apples and light acidity. It is full-bodied, which keeps the wine together, but it is too rich.",85,24.0,Champagne Blend,Chanoine,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6033,France,"An attractively perfumed wine, with white flowers, cut grass and thyme. To taste, it is soft, with the delicacy of Chardonnay giving an elegance to the intense green, crisp flavors. This should be a long-lived wine–at least 10 years.",94,85.0,Champagne Blend,Gosset,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

6036,Spain,"The Montsarra brut has really jumped in price compared to previous releases, but it also strikes us as being more complex, complete and sexy than in the past.

This is Cava in very good form.",90,23.0,Sparkling Blend,Montsarra,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

6038,Spain,"A bready, yeasty nose announces that this brut nature is more than ready to drink. In the mouth, it's smooth, but light on verve and bubbles.

6044,US,"The film director's sparkling ode to his director daughter delivers aromas of apple blossoms, pear cider and chalk.

6045,Spain,"Toasty right away, with lightly baked apple aromas. The palate has a fine feel and good overall intensity, while the flavors of lemon, white grapefruit and apple are subtle and clean.

6047,Italy,"Toasty to the point of having a popcorn-like quality, but in between those toasted, buttery notes you'll find zesty lemon and apple.

6048,France,"Salty, even briny scents dominate, along with a slightly resinous character. In the mouth this is a flavorful, rather heavy wine which carries its weight and power in the dead center of the palate. Nothing elegant here, but it's a good mouthful of fruit, finishing with an herbal-metallic note.",87,21.0,Champagne Blend,Charles Lafitte,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6049,US,"Here's a full-bodied blush sparkling wine that's rich with raspberries, strawberries, limes, toast and yeast. Mainly Pinot Noir, with 20% Chardonnay, it has a pale orange-pink color, and finishes slightly sweet.",87,24.0,Sparkling Blend,Mumm Napa,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

6054,France,"Toast and brioche aromas lead this rich, generous wine. It has considerable bottle age, meaning the youthful freshness has been replaced by a mature character. Dry in style yet quite ripe, this is a Champagne for food.",91,40.0,Champagne Blend,Vincent Couche,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6055,Spain,"If this Cava weren't so pickled in smell and taste, it would rate better. As is, it opens with white fruit, vanilla and brine aromas.

6057,France,"A deliciously dry wine, evoking flavors of crisp green-apple skins and white currants; this is elegant despite its weight and body.

6059,US,"Golden pale in color—this is so light and delicate on the palate, you'd never guess it was made almost entirely from Pinot Noir, with just 9% Chardonnay added.

6060,France,"The ripe aromas are the sign of a wine that is rich, weighty and intense. This is a vinous Champagne, rich in full-bodied yellow and white fruits, definitely suggesting rich foods.

6061,US,"What a roll Mumm Napa is on with their new releases. This blush wine shows the level of richness and elegance the winery has achieved lately.

6067,US,"Made from equal amounts of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this wine was aged on the lees for more than four years, which gives it a fabulous creamy, yeasty complexity.

Only 563 cases produced.",96,85.0,Sparkling Blend,Iron Horse,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

6069,France,"This Deutz prestige cuvée has a blend of red and white grapes (as contrasted with the blanc de blancs Amour de Deutz). It is beautifully balanced, the superripe Chardonnay giving richness to the structured red grapes. Great with spicy foods, this is a wine that has developed relatively quickly and is ready to drink now.",93,184.0,Champagne Blend,Deutz,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6070,Portugal,"Fresh, with considerable acidity, this is as crisp as it gets. Apple and lemon juice dominate the flavors, with just a light touch of softness to calm the acidity.",85,12.0,Portuguese Sparkling,Borges,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6071,France,"This classy example opens with a very floral nose and almost flower-shop aromas. But it’s not at all sweet on the palate, as tangy lime quickly moves to the fore. Impressively light and elegant, it displays some unusual elements and has a fine bead as well as a supple, herb-tinged finish.",91,37.0,Champagne Blend,H.Germain,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6072,US,"Made from mostly Pinot Noir grapes, with an addition of 8.8% Chardonnay, this Méthode Champenoise wine is sultry in raspberry cream and crème brûlée, with enough acidity to keep it fresh in the glass. The finish offers a taste of toast with ginger jam.",92,22.0,Sparkling Blend,Gloria Ferrer,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6073,Italy,"This Rosato sparkling blend is comprised of 70% Chardonnay and 30% Merlot to offer a pale pink color and creamy, white foam. The bouquet presents a pungent note followed by crisp citrus and cranberry.",84,14.0,Sparkling Blend,Le Colture,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6074,Spain,"Radiator dust, strawberry, cherry and apple-skin aromas amount to a slightly flat but not offensive nose. Likewise in the mouth: it's good and pleasant but a bit flat. Flavors of plum, berry and brine define the finish.",86,18.0,Sparkling Blend,Don Román,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6075,France,"Orange pink in color, this is a soft, medium dry wine that has pleasant raspberry flavors. It is fresh, made for those who like their sparkling wines without much acidity.",83,8.0,Sparkling Blend,Louis Perdrier,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6076,France,"With its lighter bottle (to reduce the carbon footprint of transport), this is described as a “greener” Champagne. In terms of taste, it is attractively soft, with flavors of baked apple and a tangy orange zest texture.",86,55.0,Champagne Blend,Pommery,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6077,France,"A blend of 70% Pinot Noir and 30% Chardonnay, this is a true food Champagne. “Our objective was to show how powerful Pinot Noir can get in our wines,” says Charles Philipponnat, and he is right. It is rich but dry, concentrated, slightly spicy, with weight and intensity without losing freshness from the acidity. Imported by Ex-Cellars Wine Agencies, Inc.",93,63.0,Champagne Blend,Philipponnat,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6078,Spain,"Light and clean, with dust, toast, raspberry and flowery notes to the bouquet. Fresh and properly round in the mouth, with a lot of red fruit and length. Bright, lifted and likable on the finish, with good flow. Better than most rosé Cavas.",88,18.0,Sparkling Blend,Vilarnau,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6079,France,"This beautifully fragrant offering is definitely on the dry side. It has a crisp apple flavor, accompanied by a citrus note and taut minerality. This nervy, feather-light wine is better fit for food than as an apéritif. Still young, it could age for several more years.",91,65.0,Champagne Blend,Aubry,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6080,US,"This is a finely made mix of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier grapes, light golden in color and dripping in marzipan, hazelnuts and baked bread. Complex and layered, it's got a depth of soul around zesty acidity, staying fleshy and full on the tongue.",93,40.0,Sparkling Blend,Chandon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6081,France,"A blend of Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Pinot Blanc, this is a delicious, apple-flavored wine. It's fruity, very crisp and fresh, with an orange zest edge and lively mousse. It's a fine apéritif sparkler.",88,22.0,Sparkling Blend,Domaine Zinck,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6082,France,"A style that brings in raspberry acidity to crispen the soft fruit. A texture of red apple skins gives an edge to the wine, balanced by some final soft sweetness.",85,47.0,Champagne Blend,Canard-Duchêne,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6083,France,"Dominated by rich Pinot Noir, this is still impressively youthful. It has a sense of power and concentration, with intense white fruit, yeast and just a hint of honey. It could age, but is ready to drink.",94,150.0,Champagne Blend,Gosset,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6084,France,"A salmon-infused slate color, this wine starts off gently with a nice yeast aroma. Citrus flavors interact with light boysenberry, again with a soft overlay of yeast. Crisp, with nice body and good bubbles, this is balanced and delicious.",87,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Louis Bouillot,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6085,US,"Easy to drink, with some sweetness to the pear, apricot and orange flavors, like a drizzle of honey on fresh fruit. The mousse, which creates the mouthfeel, is refined and smooth, lacking sharp edges, which adds to the impression of finesse. Overall, a very fine sparkling wine, especially considering its nonvintage status.",91,24.0,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6086,France,"Rounded, sweetened wine, with soft melon and pear flavors. It is well balanced, with some toast and acidity. It is attractive in a light, apéritif style.",86,40.0,Champagne Blend,G.H. Martel,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6087,US,"This is a pristinely fruity yet vivacious sparkling rosé. It's deft in body and scintillatingly crisp, offering layers of tart red-apple and raspberry flavors. Fine delicate froth and persistent bubbles set it apart, as does its long sugar-cookie finish.",90,45.0,Sparkling Blend,Bedell,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6088,France,"With its rich toasty aroma and ripe creamed apple palate, this is a rich Champagne reflecting the vintage. It is well balanced, with toffee softness and lime juice acidity. Not for aging, but currently very enjoyable.",90,99.0,Champagne Blend,Charles Ellner,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6089,Spain,"Dusty apple and a hint of scrambled egg define the nose on this brut nature. As you'd expect given the lack of dosage, this is citric and linear in the mouth, with stony lime and green-apple flavors. The finish is refined, clean and lemony, with green-herb flavors.",89,21.0,Sparkling Blend,Alta Alella,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6090,Spain,"A little wheaty and creamy, but also pleasantly warm, yeasty and toasty. The palate settles quickly on waxy apple and lemon, while the feel is sort of baked and a touch soft. Cider and sweet-spice notes help the finish along. Drink soon.",88,12.0,Sparkling Blend,Cristalino,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6091,France,"With its minimum of six years' bottle aging, this is a beautifully integrated, mature wine. It has a wonderful toast character, layered over sliced pears and ripe acidity. With its complex poise between lightness and richness, this remains an intensely impressive wine.",94,180.0,Champagne Blend,Krug,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6092,France,"This is ripe, smooth and toasty, with caramel and green fruit flavors. There is some sweetness, coming from the ripeness of the fruit, but the acidity gives the wine a fine balance. Imported by Plume Ridge Negociants.",87,10.0,Champagne Blend,Blason de Bourgogne,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6093,France,"Ripe, full raspberry and red cherry flavors on a delicate pink-colored wine. Crisp and dry, this shows an intense and lively acidity along with lime juice intensity. An apéritif style, very fresh.",89,62.0,Champagne Blend,Deutz,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6094,Spain,"This is flowery and open on the nose, but then it flattens out in the mouth, with mild cut and an easy bead. It tastes of soft apple and peach, while the finish fruity and satisfying.",86,16.0,Sparkling Blend,Masia Puigmoltó,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6095,US,"An unusual blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Pinot Grigio and Pinot Meunier, this bubbly is, in a word, delicious. It's ripe with oranges, pineapples, honey and vanilla, with crisp acidity and a Champagne-like sourdough leesiness.",88,22.0,Sparkling Blend,Mumm Napa,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6096,Spain,"A gem in the semisweet category, with touches of melon and banana on the nose. The palate pours on the sweet apple cider and warm citrus, while the finish is on the mark. This is a generous, no-brainer of a bubbly: Just uncork, pour, sip and smile.",89,10.0,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6097,Italy,"Here's a lovely sparkling wine that offers a floral fragrance of white flowers and tropical fruit. The palate delivers apple, white peach and a hint of almond. It has a creamy texture and a clean, crisp finish. A classic Franciacorta.",91,29.0,Sparkling Blend,Il Mosnel,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6098,Italy,"This sparkling wine has a fragrance of honey, almond and banana peel. The palate is a bit evolved, but shows ripe yellow apple, white chocolate, flint and pastry notes. It has an elegant perlage and closes on an almond note.",90,60.0,Sparkling Blend,Lorenz Martini,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6099,France,"This is a beautifully balanced and elegant offering, with pleasant fruitiness, tight acidity and a fragrant, crisp character. It's full bodied, and falls in the middle of the brut spectrum of dryness. This is ready to drink now.",92,70.0,Champagne Blend,Charles Heidsieck,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6100,France,"Toasty and yeasty on the nose, and with a pale color and fine bead, at first glance this looks very promising. And truth be told, it is pretty good, just not as good as we'd want it to be. the flavors are nice, offering more toasty elements and a bit of anise, but the mouthfeel is heavy and lacks balancing crispness.",84,20.0,Champagne Blend,Lucien Albrecht,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6101,France,"Dominated by Chardonnay, this wine has great depth of flavor, benefiting from the 13 years-aging on lees before disgorging. It is now a fine, balanced, mature wine, dominated by grilled almond and toast flavors, leaving a pure trail of acidity to finish.",94,149.0,Champagne Blend,Henriot,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6102,France,"An attractive, salmon-pink-colored wine, which has flavors of ripe strawberries and a touch of caramel. The acidity is relatively light, and the impression is of a ripe wine. Imported by Cellar Door Selections.",87,40.0,Champagne Blend,Pannier,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6103,France,"Made from Pinot Blanc, this is a plump Crémant with slightly floral aromas and lemon and lime flavors. Fresh, picking up some earthy aromas on the finish.",84,25.0,Sparkling Blend,Jean-Baptiste Adam,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6104,US,"This is made in a steely, high-acid style, harvested at low (18.5) brix and put through 25% malolactic just to keep it all in proportion. Give this some time in the glass and it shines, with a focused mix of lemon, apple and mineral flavors. This can easily age for another decade at least. Drink 2020–2030.",91,50.0,Sparkling Blend,Argyle,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6105,France,"This is on the fullish side, lacking crispness and refreshment factor. Fortunately, the ripe apple and pear flavors are charming enough to pull it through.",83,13.0,Sparkling Blend,Pierre Sparr,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6106,Spain,"Clean, dry and light on the nose, this has a smoky, leafy accent. While it's not superlively on the palate, it offers nice grapefruit, cherry and nectarine flavors, with a dry, smoky and tasty finish.",85,10.0,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6107,Italy,"Here's a wine with loads of citrus, yellow fruit, pineapple and Granny Smith apple. Rich banana and peach compliment a clean mouthfeel with snappy acidity and a dry finish. Imported by Marc de Grazia Selections.",87,16.0,Sparkling Blend,Bortolotti,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6108,Spain,"Different from the crowd. The nose concedes light raspberry and cranberry aromas, while the palate is a pink passion play that's not that easy to figure out. It's tangy, with citrus and berry mixing in an unconventional manner. Interesting in the mouth; a quality wine. Not run of the mill. Imported by De Maison Selections, Inc.",87,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Avinyó,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6109,France,"This is a salmon-pink-colored wine. On the dry side, it has a raspberry flavor and tight acidity. It has a fine, crisp character, and is fruity and lively. A wine to drink as an apéritif or with food.",88,59.0,Champagne Blend,J. Dumangin Fils,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6110,Spain,"Crisp and clean, thus it qualifies as a perfect apéritif wine. Secure in its apple and slate aromas and flavors, with a firm but persistent bead that fosters a fine mouthfeel. Best with nuts, olives, chips and especially seafood.",88,14.0,Sparkling Blend,Codorníu,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6111,France,"This is a blend of Pinots and Chardonnay. It is very open and reflective of the vintage; it's a generous wine that improves with air. Green plum flavors give the wine ripe fruit, while the acidity wells up to finish.",93,80.0,Champagne Blend,Pol Roger,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6112,France,"Very tight and crisp, this is an intensely dry wine with pristine citrus and apple-skin aromas and flavors. A steely, nervy, mineral character lends the wine a distinct ageability. Drink now–2022.",90,80.0,Champagne Blend,Jeaunaux-Robin,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6113,US,"A beautiful rosé bubbly, from the copper-salmon color to the final finish. Made from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, it's dry and refined, with complex orange, raspberry, vanilla cream, mineral and brioche flavors. Gains extra points for the smoothness of its bubbles.",90,27.0,Champagne Blend,Roederer Estate,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6114,Italy,"Ferrari's rosé sparkler offers distinctive aromas of freshly baked bread and yeast followed by wild berries, stone fruit and citrus. The mouthfeel is intense and generous and this wine boasts a particularly creamy, full and satisfying mouthfeel.",90,30.0,Sparkling Blend,Ferrari,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6115,Australia,"With a pretty onion skin color and delicate tones of bread dough, green apple, melon and bergamot, this is a wine to serve to a sophisticated audience on an elegant occasion. The fine mousse and persistent, dry finish are the perfect foil for tea sandwiches. Will gain complexity with three to four years aging.",87,20.0,Champagne Blend,Taltarni,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6116,US,"This is scoury in the mouth, with edgy corners framing straightforward orange and lime flavors. The midpalate is marked delicately with leesy sourdough notes.",85,45.0,Sparkling Blend,Chandon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6117,Spain,"An idiosyncratic wine, offering a yeasty orange marmalade aroma followed by a razor-sharp palate with sour citrus and apricot flavors. It's grating and citric on the finish, with a yeasty offset.",82,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Loxarel,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6118,US,"Rich and smooth, this has complex flavors of raspberry, almond biscotti, lime and vanilla, with a smoky note. The texture shows real finesse. Made from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, it's a first class bubbly.",92,45.0,Sparkling Blend,Chandon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6119,Moldova,"Minerally and a touch earthy on the nose, this follows with toast and sweet fruit on the palate, which is both simple and friendly. Overall, the wine has an array of good, clean flavors and a zippy finish.",83,12.0,Champagne Blend,Cricova,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6120,France,"Louise is always a light wine, almost feathery, and this 1999, now mature, maintains this style. It is delicate, its acidity just touched with toast and hints of citrus zest underneath. It doesn't have a long future, so enjoy now.",91,180.0,Champagne Blend,Pommery,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6121,France,"As it ages in bottle, this Champagne is showing real class. It remains as delicate as when reviewed last year, but it is now showing much more mature toastiness and bread flavors, and less of the green fruits. Elegance is still the main character; a fine, pure wine.",92,185.0,Champagne Blend,Pommery,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6122,Spain,"Cherry and dusty cinnamon aromas blend with a touch of cough drop on the nose, while the full-bodied palate pits spicy berry and plum against rather soft acidity. Finishes sweet for a burst, then dry and peppery. Alluring rosado. Imported by European Cellars.",87,35.0,Sparkling Blend,Gramona,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6123,France,"A pure, fresh line runs through this delicate rosé. It shows more white fruits than red, just hinting at red currants, but more of fresh white berries. There is just some hint of sweetness, more from the fruit of 2003 than from any extra dosage.",92,70.0,Champagne Blend,Louis Roederer,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6124,France,"A structured, crisp and mineral-driven wine, this merely hints at raspberry flavors but is dedicated to a steely character. That suggests youth, and the wine, with its tense texture, could well age over several more years. For now, this is an impressive wine that demands pairing with food.",93,72.0,Champagne Blend,Louis Roederer,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6125,France,"Herb and mineral aromas and flavors prevail in this dry, light-to-medium-weight sparkler. It has decent texture, but the flavors bear a medicinal quality ending with a slight bitterness.",82,15.0,Champagne Blend,Royale NV Brut,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6126,Argentina,"Popcorn, green-apple and scallion aromas precede crisp, tart flavors of barely ripe peach and grapefruit. The finish is short and citrusy, boosted by choppy acids. Racy but not rich.",83,10.0,Champagne Blend,Familia Schroeder,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6127,US,"This is an absolutely first-rate bubbly, dry, smooth and rich. Has complex flavors of peaches, limes and strawberries, accented by doughy yeast and smoky flavors. Really defines the balanced elegance and pedigree you want in a great sparkler.",92,22.0,Sparkling Blend,Roederer Estate,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6128,Spain,"Dry, yeasty aromas of citrus and fresh-baked bread are, as expected for a brut nature, clean and focused. Flavors of white fruits, green herbs and citrus finish fresh, with more than adequate fruit and balance.",90,31.0,Sparkling Blend,Vins El Cep,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6129,US,"A brut-style Pinot Noir and Chardonnay blend, this sparkler is really good, and easily worth its relatively modest cost. It drinks rich and fine, with an elegant, dry structure framing complex, honeyed flavors of strawberries, limes, vanilla, leesy yeast and smoke. Will easily stand aging through 2010.",92,30.0,Sparkling Blend,Mumm Napa,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6130,Spain,"This small-production Cava from Muga in Rioja is elegant, lemony and tight as a drum. Aromas of apple, lime and yeast set up an acidic palate with modest lemon and apple flavors and a linear, focused feel. Finishes with zest and kick.",87,25.0,Sparkling Blend,Muga,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6131,Italy,"This is a bright and luminous Italian sparkler that would pair well with white meat, roasted fish and vegetables. Aromas are clean and bright and the wine offers a fresh, tonic feel in the mouth.",88,35.0,Sparkling Blend,Ronco Calino,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6132,US,"This blend of 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay from the Fess Parker team offers lemon blossom, baking soda and lime zest aromas on the light and flowery nose. Broad flavors of yellow apple and pear meet with a citrus twist on the finish.",90,45.0,Sparkling Blend,Fesstivity,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6133,France,"This has a touch of toast and a rich character. A creamed pear note mingles with lime-driven acidity and a delicious, warm tropical-fruit aftertaste.",91,60.0,Champagne Blend,Charles Ellner,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6134,France,"A strawberry-fruited wine, with a pink sunset color and light, very fresh fruit. The aftertaste is soft and gentle.",86,43.0,Champagne Blend,Nicolas Feuillatte,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6135,France,"While demi-sec is the description, this almost as dry as some Brut Champagnes. Its flavors are of walnuts and pear juice along with a fine drive of acidity. This is food Champagne, looking for richer white fish or scallops as a pairing.",89,46.0,Champagne Blend,Mailly Grand Cru,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6136,France,"There are hints of bottle age on this strawberry-flavored wine. They give it a more woody, toasty character that takes away from the freshness that a wine like this needs. The aftertaste conveys caramel and spice.",85,32.0,Sparkling Blend,Domaine des Baumard,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6137,France,"This is baseline Deutz, but still a standout. Sniff it and you sense the complexity, definition and elegance. Good, tiny bubbles stream up steadily, bringing notes of chalk, candied fruit and caramel. In the mouth, it fills out across the palate with mixed flavors that show stone fruits, caramel and oily, slightly buttery nuts. Very approachable yet complex, refined and aristocratic.",90,51.0,Champagne Blend,Deutz,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6138,Spain,"Narrow but perfectly acceptable on the nose, with white fruit aromas, this may not have much feel and style, but the flavors of soda cracker, lime and apple are dry, ending on a baking spice note.",85,13.0,Sparkling Blend,Gran Sarao,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6139,US,"Lots of ripe raspberry, strawberry and lime flavors are found in this sweetish blush bubbly. It's brisk in acidity, with a nice doughiness, although it could be smoother.",87,40.0,Sparkling Blend,Chandon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6140,Spain,"Comes out of the chute with some aggression, but that's settled by quality apple and grassy aromas. The palate is jumpy and lively, with pleasant, slightly sweet apple and peach flavors. Shows good refinement, ample layering of flavors and a spot of minerality. As a whole, this is good cava.",88,17.0,Sparkling Blend,Montsarra,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6141,US,"This is the winery's sweet bubbly, and it will appeal to fans of sweet wines. The orange, vanilla and honeysuckle flavors are delicious and easy. The blend is Flora, Gewürztraminer and Pinot Noir.",87,38.0,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6142,Italy,"Apple and green herbs on the nose are more convincing than the flavor profile, which deals applesauce and buttered toast. Fairly weighty on the palate, but clean and correct as a whole.",85,18.0,Sparkling Blend,Foss Marai,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6143,France,"Initially fruity, this attractive, pink-colored rosé subsequently shows a definite texture. There is a bite of lemon juice and a sharp, edgy acidity that give the wine an mouthwatering freshness. Age this for a few months.",89,45.0,Champagne Blend,Charles Ellner,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6144,South Africa,"Vibrantly effervescent and bursting with ripe, juicy strawberry and cherry fruit notes, this has a fine-sandpaper-like texture. It's an interesting selection that would pair well with barbecue or pulled-pork dishes.",86,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Solms-Delta,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6145,France,"A Champagne that is very much wine. The structure and the richness are just right for a food wine, showing ripe acidity, flavors of plums and apricots, and balancing these primary fruits with a dense, complex structure that takes in yeast, maturity and a tight apple skin finish.",93,100.0,Champagne Blend,Mandois,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6146,France,"The tiny mousse tells a lot about the quality of this impressive Champagne. It is quite full in style, with flavors of white currants and a rich, but still bone-dry aftertaste. It is a perfect food Champagne, with structure and a good tension between richness and elegance. Imported by Robert Chadderdon Selections.",92,45.0,Champagne Blend,Billecart-Salmon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6147,Spain,"Cidery aromas vie with bready notes to give the bouquet complexity. This feels zesty, juicy and citric, with a lean, racy body. Apple cider, green herb, lime and scallion flavors finish with a lasting taste of lime.",88,18.0,Sparkling Blend,Paul Cheneau,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6148,Spain,"Pickled and leesy on the nose, this kosher Cava runs low on verve and bubbles. Scallion, green herb and green banana flavors finish similarly, with herbal notes leading the way. 100% Macabeo.",85,18.0,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6149,France,"Using only grapes from Mumm's own grand cru vineyards, winemaker Dominique Demarville has produced this impressive new cuvée. With a high proportion of reserve wines (from previous vintages), this is a well-integrated, elegant wine, with citrus charac ers and just a light touch of honey. Imported by Allied Domecq Wines USA.",93,60.0,Champagne Blend,G. H. Mumm,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6150,South Africa,"A very pretty nose of fresh flowers, citrus and creamy toast leads into a balanced, rich Chardonnay-like character on the palate. Minerally, clean, fresh but serious, this wine is food-friendly and elegant. Imported by GBW, LLC.",88,16.0,Champagne Blend,Graham Beck,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6151,US,"Sparkling wine is all about texture, and the mouthfeel on this Chardonnay-based bubbly lacks refinement. The bubbles are scoury and the finish is rough. Still, it has rich citrus, yeast, honey and pear flavors.",85,22.0,Sparkling Blend,River Road,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6152,Spain,"Fresh, clean apple and white-peach aromas are good but not overly expressive or complex. This feels fresh and lifted, with minerally, stony flavors of apple and lime. A clean, pointed finish feels nice and tastes like lettuce and bitter greens.",88,25.0,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6153,Spain,"Some early pickle and sauerkraut aromas were worrisome until they completely disappeared. Left in their wake are flavors of apple juice and peaches, while the mouthfeel registers as solid and full. A little funky and definitely not for everyone, given the wine's overt sweetness and oddities.",85,9.0,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6154,Italy,"Here's an Italian sparkling rosé with a peachy-pink color and a wide aromatic offering that includes hints of clove, peach, melon and toasted nut. The wine is smooth and slightly soft although those piquant bubbles give it a sharper edge.",89,43.0,Sparkling Blend,Quadra,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6155,France,"Quite foamy and shaded toward very pale salmon/copper, this young wine tastes of green apples, spice, wild strawberry and cherry candy. It's pretty, clean and light, but thins out a bit quickly.",87,47.0,Champagne Blend,Vranken,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6156,France,"High acidity shows both that this is a young wine, and that 2000 is not a particularly ripe vintage. There is some attractive tannic structure here, but this will always be a relatively austere wine.",89,74.0,Champagne Blend,Louis Roederer,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6157,Spain,"This is slightly smoky, toasty and yeasty up front, with a touch of matchstick to the nose. Rich, sweet tasting and candied on the palate, it has baking spice, apple and honeydew flavors. It's tasty throughout and just elevated enough in mouthfeel to earn a few complexity points.",88,18.0,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6158,France,"A wine with good bottle age along with yeasty acidity and a fine citrus character. It is a light style, with just a hint of toast. The acidity is delicious.",89,55.0,Champagne Blend,Delamotte,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6159,France,"This is the palest of pinks. To taste, also, it is more a white than a rosé. There's just that touch of structure to add complexity to the deliciously fresh green-apple fruit flavors.",89,70.0,Champagne Blend,Pommery,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6160,France,"While 2005 is not a great vintage in Champagne, in the right hands, as here, it can produce some fine wines. This is beautifully balanced, a contrast between soft fruit and a touch of maturity. It is not a wine for long aging, and will be completely ready in a year.",93,74.0,Champagne Blend,Gaston Chiquet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6161,France,"A fresh, lively Champagne, quite soft with crisp white pears and a light sweetness which integrates well with the fruit. Young, without complexity, a good apéritif Champagne.",87,37.0,Champagne Blend,Charles Lafitte,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6162,US,"The fruit flavors are apparent, fresh and lively in this medium-bodied, beautifully balanced brut. Light pear and pineapple aromas are followed by richer pear and citrus flavors, and subtle hints of baking spices, almonds and a nice earthy touch emerge.",92,24.0,Sparkling Blend,Roederer Estate,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6163,Spain,"There's a bit of bramble, hard spice and forest fire smoke on the nose, but the palate is largely fresh, with red-fruit flavors such as plum and wild raspberry. The wine is ripe, a bit sweet and solid on the finish. Imported by Altuve Foods and Beverage.",86,19.0,Sparkling Blend,Vallformosa,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6164,France,"Rich, sumptuous wine that shows weight of ripe fruit, a smooth texture and delicious peach and apple flavors. The crisp edge comes from a lemon zest burst, breaking out of the minerality.",88,25.0,Sparkling Blend,René Muré,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6165,US,"This blend of Chardonnay and Muscat Canelli is frankly sweet, in the Rock Wall style, but not too much, and fine acidity and a tangy minerality help provide balance. The orange, vanilla and honeysuckle flavors are delicious.",87,18.0,Sparkling Blend,Rock Wall,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6166,Spain,"Very round and candied, with a ton of vanilla on the nose. It's made in the supersweet style, as if it's supposed to go with wedding cake or caramel bon bons. Yet there's enough balance to keep it on an even keel, which should make it perfect for those raised on candy-sweet wines and their kin. Certainly not to everyone's liking but not a poorly made wine by any means.",86,10.0,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6167,France,"A gloriously rich rosé that is full of ripe raspberries that burst in the mouth. It has a tight texture, balanced by a rounded feel. It is still young, of course, and the sweet finish needs time to integrate. Even so, relish the wine now, or wait 3–4 years.",93,290.0,Champagne Blend,Taittinger,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6168,Italy,"This lovely brut offers a fragrance of white peach, almond and acacia flower. The palate delivers apple and citrus flavors, along with a note of bread crust. The wine is fresh and creamy with a dry finish of roasted walnut.",90,32.0,Sparkling Blend,Le Marchesine,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6169,Italy,"From one of Franciacorta's leading producers, Gran Cuvée Pas Operé offers an enticing fragrance of acacia flower, white flowers and beeswax. The creamy palate delivers apple, nut, spice, thyme and sage along with fine, persistent effervescence.",92,50.0,Sparkling Blend,Bellavista,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6170,Spain,"This is a serious Cava for the money. It's mildly briny and dusty up front, with peach and apple notes filling out the nose. The palate is elegant and smooth enough, while apple and melon flavors are naturally spicy and ripe given the warm conditions of the '09 vintage. The long, nectarine-flavored finish will win you over.",89,14.0,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6171,France,"A new blend of this best-selling Champagne is soft, creamy and openly fruity. There is acidity, but it is kept in place by the intensity of sweet fruit, which trails off to a soft, gentle finish.",87,35.0,Champagne Blend,Moët & Chandon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6172,US,"This straightforward sparkler has a hay and lemon nose. The flavors are fruity but not cloying, and turn drier on the finish. The creamy texture and soft fizziness of this likeable bubbly hit all the right notes for mass appeal, including a lively, jazzy bottle.",84,7.0,Champagne Blend,Cook's,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6173,Italy,"Emozione is a lovely sparkling wine with a floral fragrance of acacia and orange blossom. The palate offers white peach and apricot flavors, along with toasted walnut notes. It's long and linear, with a refined perlage.",90,37.0,Sparkling Blend,Villa,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6174,US,"This multivintage bottling is extraordinarily rich in orange fruit. You'll find complex layers of smoky butter, yeasty brioche, vanilla and toasted oak. What's so remarkable, though, is the mouthfeel: While it's brisk in acidity, it feels as soft and gentle as satin. It's so beautiful now that you'll find it difficult to keep from drinking the entire magnum immediately.",97,189.0,Sparkling Blend,Iron Horse,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6175,France,"An attractive, rich Champagne with a good balance between its ripe apple and citrus flavors as well as some intense textured fruit skins and minerality. Not for aging, but a fine Champagne.",86,40.0,Champagne Blend,Charles de Cazanove,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6176,US,"A nice brut-style sparkling wine, made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. It's clean and crisp in acidity, with seemingly sweet flavors of orange, lime, raspberry and dough.",87,16.0,Sparkling Blend,Korbel,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6177,US,"A good brut-style wine, a little sweet in the dosage, but with sound acidity. The bubbles are scoury. The blend is 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay.",86,33.0,Sparkling Blend,Iron Horse,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6178,France,"The principal difference between Blanquette and Cremant de Limoux is in the proportion of Mauzac which has to be in the blend—more for the Blanquette. Which is why this wine has 90% Mauzac, more spice than fruit, and finishes with flavors of grilled almonds.",87,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Sieur d'Arques,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6179,US,"Shows some hints of light toast on the nose, followed by pineapples and pears on the palate. It's creamy and smooth in the mouth, but has a suggestion of sweetness that distracts slightly from what should be a crisp, clean finish.",84,18.0,Sparkling Blend,Martha Clara,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6180,France,"Very soft and unfocused, this is in a full style, flavored with pink grapefruit and sweet lime. But it feels heavy in the mouth, obviously working better with food, but also showing signs of the sugar in the dosage.",83,68.0,Champagne Blend,Canard-Duchêne,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6181,Spain,"Leesy, bready aromas are ripe and fruity. This is soft in feel and a touch heavy, which may be a reflection of the warm 2009 vintage. Nectarine and other ripe flavors finish full and sweet. This almost tastes like a brut Cava despite being a brut nature.",89,16.0,Sparkling Blend,Juvé y Camps,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6182,US,"Even at five years old, this remains a young, vigorous but rather heavy sparkling wine. Made mainly from Pinot Noir, with the remainder Chardonnay, it has a dark salmon color and is strong in acidity, with raspberry, vanilla and dough flavors. The different parts are not in harmony quite yet. Give it 3–5 years.",89,50.0,Sparkling Blend,Iron Horse,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6183,France,"This has a relatively high dosage, producing a ripe strawberry flavor. It's full bodied, touched by a spice note, as well as some toast from bottle age. The finish shows that this is a rosé fit for food.",89,110.0,Champagne Blend,Pol Roger,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6184,France,"Strawberry/salmon pink, this party-ready wine comes on light as a feather. Almost frothy, it's delicate, like whipped butter; its richness is suggested rather than felt. All the pieces are in balance, but very light, and perhaps in a tasting with bigger, more powerful wines it seems insubstantial. But it's quite well made, creamy, spicy and refreshing.",88,60.0,Champagne Blend,Taittinger,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6185,France,"Made from 80% Pinot Noir, this simple, fresh rosé has good raspberry aromas and tastes. It is a fruit salad of flavors, red fruits, peaches and acidity all combining well. A good summer apéritif.",85,11.0,Sparkling Blend,Kriter,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6186,Spain,"Consistency at a good price is what this textbook cava is all about. The bouquet offers your basic fruit-cocktail aromas, while the palate is sort of plump as it pours on the nectarine and ripe peach flavors. Easygoing, with some weight and roundness.",87,9.0,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6187,France,"A beautiful ripe, soft and fruity wine. The acidity is sweet, crisp pears and apricots giving a rich character. This is a vintage that is for drinking, not aging.",90,99.0,Champagne Blend,Drappier,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6188,Spain,"Leesy aromas of wheat and corn are low on fruit and general appeal. This feels regular at best. Grassy gaseous flavors of bitter melon, lime and apple finish leesy and uncommitted, with flabby weight. For whatever reason, this is below prior benchmarks.",84,25.0,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6189,France,"One of the grandest single vineyards in Champagne, an immensely steep south-facing hillside that dominates Mareuil-sur-Aÿ. From here, Philipponnat is able to produce powerful wines with toasty, ripe fruit, powered with yeast and flavors of hazelnuts and white fruits. While not as tense and without the aging potential of 1998, this is without doubt a great Champagne.",94,200.0,Champagne Blend,Philipponnat,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6190,France,"With its source of grapes from northern Burgundy, this cool, collected wine is as close to Champagne in taste as is possible. Balancing Chardonnay with some Aligoté, it is the richness of the Chardonnay that wins out, giving a ripe, creamy wine that could benefit from some bottle age. Imported by Vitis Imports.",90,19.0,Sparkling Blend,Paul Delane,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6191,Spain,"Leesy fleshy papaya aromas come with a touch of sulfur and harshness. This feels solid, albeit modest in bubbles. Flavors of apple and green melon are lasting and steady on the finish.",88,23.0,Sparkling Blend,Albet I Noya,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6192,France,"This wine is soft and creamy, although it does seem to miss out on fruit and freshness. It is smooth and ripe, with an aftertaste that is lightly off dry.",84,12.0,Sparkling Blend,Monmousseau,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6193,US,"The refined texture recommends this brut, which is mainly Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, with a splash of Pinot Meunier. It's an elegant wine, rich in citrus fruits, green apples, raspberries, smoke and creamy yeast, but it's very young and aggressive. Needs time. Cellar through 2012.",92,40.0,Sparkling Blend,Chandon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6194,US,"This is Mumm Napa's workhorse brut. It's a beautiful sparkling wine that satisfies the basics of elegance and lusciousness. Shows raspberry, lime, brioche and smoky flavors, with a slightly sweet dosage and a refined mousse.",90,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Mumm Napa,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6195,France,"Sure it's a bit simple and fruity—the flavors run toward berries and citrus—but it's also cleanly made, with a slightly creamy mouthfeel and a soft, easy-drinking finish.",84,16.0,Sparkling Blend,Patriarche Père et Fils,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6196,US,"This late-disgorged wine has been released at the age of 11 years. It's a beautiful wine, notable especially for the ultrafine feeling of the mousse, or bubbles. So refined and silky. Rich too are the flavors, in limes, strawberries, toasty lees and minerals. A spectacular sparkling wine that has many years of development ahead.",95,50.0,Sparkling Blend,Gloria Ferrer,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6197,US,"Definitely on the sweet side, like iced strawberry tea with white sugar. But It's clean and crisp and bubbly.",85,13.0,Sparkling Blend,Four Paws & A Tail,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6198,France,"This is a rich-yet-dry selection, with a lively mousse and a ripe apple flavor. It feels rich, touched by toast, and its acidity serves as an attractive contrast. This nonvintage has some bottle age to round out the finish.",89,89.0,Champagne Blend,Tendil & Lombardi,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6199,Spain,"Give this stylish wine a few minutes to rev its engine and you'll be rewarded with warm pear and apple aromas. The palate is equally nice as it focuses on apple, pear and peach flavors. The finish is relatively long, clean and pretty, and overall it's a very nice wine with a hint of intricacy and complexity.",89,13.0,Sparkling Blend,Juvé y Camps,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6200,US,"Salmon pink in color, this starts with a burst of raspberry cream and vanilla aromas, and turns rich and creamy on the palate. Has pretty fruit flavors of raspberries and strawberries, it's drier than you expect, more fruity than sweet. Closes with an ultraclean finish.",87,13.0,Champagne Blend,Korbel,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6201,South Africa,"A distinct note of honeycomb marries harmoniously with the pear and hard nectarine aromas. A nice creaminess fills the mouth, with green apple and citrus flavors, which finish on an appropriately toasty yet mouthwatering note. This already shows nice development; drink now.",87,55.0,Sparkling Blend,Graham Beck,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6202,France,"Soft, sweet wine with crushed strawberry flavors that show a high dosage and sweet acidity. It is full-bodied, rich, but not well balanced.",86,50.0,Champagne Blend,Drappier,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6203,Australia,"Pale straw with a touch of green to its hue, this is a soft, easygoing Moscato redolent of oranges and pineapples. Finishes fresh and clean despite considerable sweetness.",86,13.0,Sparkling Blend,De Bortoli,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6204,US,"This is the winery's sweet sparkling wine. It has the elegant structure, fine acidity and forward raspberry, strawberry, lime, vanilla and smoke flavors of the dry bruts, with a sugary finish, for those who like their bubblies on the sweet side.",86,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Mumm Napa,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6205,France,"Only disgorged in 2007, this fine vintage wine has preserved all its freshness. There are white fruits, pear juice, a crisp texture. They combine well to create a wine with considerable minerality, flinty, but full in the mouth. Age over the next 4–5 years.",93,75.0,Champagne Blend,Philipponnat,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6206,Spain,"The bouquet seems nutty and salinic, and overall this extra dry (meaning fairly sweet) focuses on soft and sugary mango and melon flavors. It's not as lively as it needs to be to balance the sweetness, so ultimately the wine comes up a touch flat. Imported by Freixenet USA.",84,12.0,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6207,France,"A bright yellow wine with fine bubbles and a full mouthfeel. A touch of yeast enhances crisp citrus aromas, while the flavors are lemon-lime followed by the extended citrus family. Good acidity keeps it racy.",85,8.0,Sparkling Blend,Grandin,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6208,Australia,"A zippy, energized sparkler, with lots of grilled brioche, melon and apple notes that linger nicely on the finish. Has solid length and definition along with a fine mousse. A winner all round. Drink now or hold several years for more complexity.",89,32.0,Champagne Blend,Clover Hill,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6209,Spain,"This is light, mildly yeasty, slightly pickled and briny smelling. It feels fresh and edgy, with good acidic cut, while the flavors lean toward orange and white peach. It holds onto its briny character on the finish, which is dry, bracing and tastes of mineral and lime.",88,19.0,Sparkling Blend,Princesa,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6210,Italy,"A blend of 55% Pinot Nero and 45% Chardonnay, this opens with aromas of honey, beeswax, acacia, vanilla and toast.

6211,France,"Gosset's reserve bottling is always a rich, textured wine packed with an appealing flavor parade of fruits, toast, nuts and vanilla. Ripe and doughy, it's not what you would call subtle or particularly elegant. But if it's big, ripe flavors you want, with plenty of fruit, here you go.",90,60.0,Champagne Blend,Gosset,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6212,France,"Only produced from Grand Cru vineyards, this ripe wine offers yellow fruit flavors cut by dry tangy citrus acidity. It's full in the mouth, with a creamy mousse and attractive freshness. The wine, with its hints of toast as well as fruit, is ready to drink.",91,50.0,Champagne Blend,Pehu-Simonet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6213,France,"Literally timeless, L'Intemporelle is an elegant, almost discreet style. It downplays the rich fruit to present a stylish wine, with citrus highlights over ripe yellow fruit. This 2005 is still young; age for 3–4 years.",91,80.0,Champagne Blend,Mailly Grand Cru,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6214,France,"While it has very bready and yeasty aromas, you can taste the crisp fruits through this. It's an elegantly dry Champagne, with a pure line of white fruits and acidity that go with the beautiful structure. As befits the 1996 vintage, this will certainly age.",94,120.0,Champagne Blend,Jacquesson et Fils,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6215,France,"A wild blend of six grape varieties grown in the Loire, the Cognac region and south-west France. It hasn't helped to give character to what is a simple, easy wine, with some pleasant pear flavors and a soft aftertaste.",84,12.0,Sparkling Blend,Grandin,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6216,Australia,"Light and fresh, this 100% Chardonnay sparkler features slightly gingery, briny, biscuity aromas and crisp, balanced finish. At the price, the only serious competition is Cava, with its decidedly different flavors.",85,10.0,Sparkling Blend,De Bortoli,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6217,US,"Pleasant and tasty, this has the raspberry, lime, dough and smoke flavors typical of a fine California sparkling wine.

6218,France,"There's a strong, nutty character to this bubbly, with accents of Granny Smith apple, toast and lemon rind citrus on the nose and mouth. The rich mouth is full and satisfying, but the alcohol is a bit warming on the close.",85,12.0,Sparkling Blend,Delmas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

6220,Spain,"Light in color with aromas of finely scented bath soap, strawberry, fresh cream and steel. The palate is a touch sweeter than you might expect, and that's because this is 60% Monastrell (Mourvèdre) along with Garnacha and Pinot Noir. Still, it's an elegant wine with punch bowl flavors.",91,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Llopart,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

6223,US,"Marked by its soft, mousse-like refinement, this sparkling wine is sheer silk and satin in the mouth. On the palate, the raspberry, lime and vanilla flavors are subtle, while leesy doughiness and oakiness bring a touch of smoke. This is a beautiful wine for a celebratory toast, or to enjoy with lobster, crab or scallops. It would also perfect a weekend brunch alongside plain old scrambled eggs and buttered toast.",96,98.0,Sparkling Blend,Iron Horse,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6224,US,"A little sweet, and kind of rough and sandpapery, but it fits the bill when you need a quick bubbly to celebrate.",83,9.0,Sparkling Blend,Barefoot Bubbly,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6225,US,"A delicious sparkler; shows the delicacy and elegance of a blanc de blancs at its California best. The Chardonnay contributes subtle peach and citrus   flavors, and the mousse, or bubbly mouthfeel, is very refined. Should age well. Drink now–2009, at least.",92,75.0,Sparkling Blend,Domaine Carneros,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6226,France,"The vintage Moët seems a bit sugary, with broad, simple flavors. It's a blocky wine; a bit of citrus here, some butterscotch there, and that sugary kick to the finish. Just a bit too paint-by-the-numbers.",87,53.0,Champagne Blend,Moët & Chandon,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6227,France,"Richly toasty, showing hints of brioche dough and French toast on the nose, then delivering toast, apple and citrus flavors in a medium-weight format. Finishes dry, crisp and lemony. A solid choice in NV brut.",88,43.0,Champagne Blend,Delamotte,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

6229,US,"This is as fine a rosé sparkling wine as has ever been produced in California. Almost 50-50 Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, it has rich flavors of cherries, raspberries, vanilla, toast and creamy lees, in the style of Champagne, and is completely dry and very crisp in acidity. Fabulously drinkable now, it should develop well over the next 6–8 years.",94,70.0,Sparkling Blend,Roederer Estate,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6230,Spain,"Forward and direct up front, this has a yeasty but fresh apple aroma. It feels clean and ready, with lemon-lime and kiwi flavors that lead to a fresh finish. This is textbook Cava with some sweetness.",85,12.0,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6231,France,"With its aromas of fresh hay, this is strangely mature for such a young wine. It seems to already have reached the toast and butter stage, leaving most of its fresh fruit behind. It's drinkable, but won't keep.",85,100.0,Champagne Blend,Vranken,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6232,Spain,"Toasty and a touch oily on the nose, this has green fruit aromas of lime and kiwi.

6233,Italy,"This sparkler has a uniquely chiseled, polished or fine-tuned quality to it that sets it apart and gives it loads of spectacular character.

Imported by Wine Emporium.",92,53.0,Sparkling Blend,Monte Rossa,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

6235,US,"Pure Chardonnay, Luxe is finished at lower alcohol (at least according to the fact sheets) than the other sparklers in this lineup.

6236,France,"Since he created his company in 1981, Bruno Paillard has become an important force in Champagne, owning a number of other brands. But his top wines are made under his own name; they go for finesse and elegance. This bottling also has a touch of mature, toasty acid flavors. The bottles carry the year of disgorgement—an excellent idea. Imported by Vintus LLC.",92,44.0,Champagne Blend,Bruno Paillard,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

6238,US,"Made from a mix of 58% Chardonnay and 42% Pinot Noir, this delivers sweet peach and homemade biscuit scents. A dry, seductive mousse gives it body, while moderate acidity—which presents as fresh lemon peel flavor—gives it lift.",90,50.0,Sparkling Blend,Grand Napa,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6239,France,"A wine that manages to straddle the twin peaks of freshness and maturity with ease.

6240,Spain,"This is wide and sweet on the bouquet, with pear and cider aromas. It feels thick and a bit grabby, with basic apple flavor and not much more. Long on the finish, it has a decent feel if you don't mind some excess foam.",84,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Dominio de la Vega,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6241,France,"Full-bodied and rich, with the open, lively fruits typical of 1995-vintage Champagne. It does have plenty of crisp acidity in support of its generous flavors and its long-lasting, soft aftertaste.",90,60.0,Champagne Blend,Laurent-Perrier,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

6243,Spain,"Tight and honest from the start, with match stick, yeast, bitter greens and apple aromas.

6249,France,"Toasted English muffin greets the nose, while the palate embraces ripe, almost tropical white fruit flavors. There's acidity but it's low, making this seem more like a still wine with bubbles than a Mousseux.",83,10.0,Sparkling Blend,Charles de Fère,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6250,France,"This Champagne, full of richness and fresh acidity, is a wine designed for food. With its weight and intensity of flavor, along with the low dosage, it is still full-bodied, leaving a toasty character. This is the 729th nonvintage blending produced by Jacquesson since 1898 (when the house was 100 years old), hence the number.

6251,Spain,"Lime and mineral aromas drive the nose on this fairly full-bodied brut nature from a warm vintage. On the palate, this is balanced, with bubbles absorbed into the wine's fabric.

6252,Lithuania,"Heady floral and honey scents mingled with a freshness give this sparkler a distinctive edge, and on the palate, the lush sweetness is lifted by good acidity. The wine is undeniably sweet, but minerality keeps it from being cloying.",84,10.0,Sparkling Blend,Alita,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6253,Spain,"Among Cavas, this is one of the more yeasty, full-bodied and creamy wines you'll find; it's also cidery, dusty and heavy on the nose. Round, it offers plenty of depth to frame the flavors of candied peach, melon, pear, tarragon and thyme. Although it's a bit foamy and coarse, overall this is a flavorful, complex, demanding Cava to drink now–2015.",89,30.0,Sparkling Blend,Gramona,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6254,US,"A beautiful sparkling wine, and a rare release from this winery that usually produces multi-county blends. It has incredibly complex, dry flavors of Meyer lemons, limes, brioche, vanilla, sweet lees and smoky barrel that change with every sip.

6258,France,"As labeled, this zero-dosage wine is bone dry.

6263,Italy,"Made from organically grown grapes, this impressive sparkler is made with no sugar or liqueur added.

6264,US,"The best of Schramsberg's current bubblies, for the smoothness and finesse of its mousse and subtlety of flavor, high acidity and impeccable structure.

6268,Spain,"Aromatically, this is pretty good as dry apple and a pinch of green herbs work the nose. In the mouth, however, this is shear and citric, with zesty, almost sour flavors of tangerine, orange and grapefruit. The finish is similar, with thinly cut acidity causing tartness.",83,11.0,Sparkling Blend,Codorníu,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6269,France,"This is a classic Dom Pérignon vintage. It's big and fruity initially, a mouthful of ripeness. Then the texture and structure of this dense wine come through.

6295,Australia,"This longtime favorite seems to have gotten sweeter over the years, and I think it's about reached its limit, as there's just enough acidity for a semblance of balance.

6302,Spain,"Smells oily, stemmy and a bit funky, while the palate is sweet in the extra dry mold, with candied white-fruit, vanilla and powdered sugar flavors.

6303,France,"This tastes soft and almost off-dry, despite its brut label. The flavors are of off-ripe apple, creamed pear and a light taste of acidity. It's all fine and in balance, it just misses vivacity and freshness.",84,40.0,Champagne Blend,Ernest Rapeneau,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

6312,France,"From the family-owned J. Dumangin, this is a full, fruity, ripe wine that's full of sweet apple and lime flavors, with a bright orange-zest texture.

6340,Italy,"Snappy yet smooth, with subtle apple, toast and vanilla aromas. Very good in terms of feel, with dry, spicy flavors of baked apple, white pepper and herbs.

6341,Spain,"Toasty aromas include popcorn, scrambled egg and briny white fruits. There's smoothness to the ripe palate, while apple, peach and citrus flavors—the Big Three of cava—finish fruity and with stuffing. This is a ripe winner that's richer and more flavorful than your average brut nature.",90,35.0,Sparkling Blend,Castellroig,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6342,France,"Pale pink in hue, it is soft and fresh. There are red fruits, a light tang of texture and a hint of the red wine that went into the blend. It's an attractive, apéritif style of rosé, all fruit and fragrance.",88,84.0,Champagne Blend,Taittinger,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6343,France,"Here's a real Champagne curiosity, wine made from six grape varieties. Apart from the usual three (Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier), there are Pinot Blanc, Petite Meslier and Arbanne, a variety that is almost extinct. All are permitted under Champagne rules. The Arbanne gives a very floral character to the wine, which is attractive and unlike any Champagne you will ever drink. With such ripeness, it tastes like it came from Carneros, rather than Champagne.",87,48.0,Champagne Blend,Moutard Père et Fils,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6344,South Africa,"The sweet edge to this sparkler makes it quite attractive and a pleasant alternative to the more common dry styles typically served today. The nose offers notes of toast, apple skins and pineapple core while the mouth shows riper flavors of peaches and cream and a hint of honey. Overall, a fun and well-balanced semi-sweet sparkler.",85,16.0,Champagne Blend,Graham Beck,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6345,France,"A superbly ripe Champagne that has all the open generosity of the 1998 vintage. Peach and apricot aromas are followed by flavors of hazelnuts, honey and spices. Of course, it is still very young, and, like all vintages of La Grande Dame, it will age for many years.",92,120.0,Champagne Blend,Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6346,US,"Made from 100% Chardonnay, this bubbly shows Schramsberg's ease of producing rich, clean and elegant sparkling wines. It's delicious now in vanilla, yeast, lime and Asian pear flavors, with some sweetness from the dosage, but try giving it 5–6 years in the cellar.",91,37.0,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6347,France,"Fragrant wine, attractively perfumed, crisply fresh. It is full of ripe apples, layered with intense acidity and balanced with a warmer peach flavor. Ready to drink.",86,23.0,Sparkling Blend,Louis Sipp,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6348,Italy,"This feminine, delicate rosé sparkling wine from northern Italy opens with a beautiful peachy-pink color and lively aromas of stone fruit, cranberry, pink rose, dried grass and crushed mineral. Pair this wine with caviar or smoked salmon.",91,78.0,Sparkling Blend,Bellavista,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6349,France,"Beautiful pale onion skin color, with a light aroma of strawberries. These simple initial attributes mask a much more complex wine. The fruit flavors are blended in with toast, with some wood and fresh, lifting acidity. A serious rosé.",92,74.0,Champagne Blend,Louis Roederer,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6350,England,"Creamy notes of Golden Pearmain apple, shortcrust pastry and juicy green apple meld into a golden, elegant unity.

This is grown-up, serious stuff with quite a lot of beautiful, echoing resonance, even grace.",92,39.0,Sparkling Blend,Ridgeview Estate,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6351,Argentina,"This Pinot Noir-heavy sparkler opens with aromas of briny citrus and bready yeast. The palate is fresh and low on weight, with a dominating flavor of pink grapefruit. Overall, this is basic but easy to drink.",85,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Cruzat,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6352,France,"A balanced wine, with softness that indicates a relatively high dosage. There is no complexity, but the wine is light, creamy, flavored with green plums and kiwi, just edged with bitterness.",85,40.0,Champagne Blend,Vranken,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6353,US,"More full-bodied than the winery's brut, this Pinot Noir-based bubbly also is richer. It's just beautiful in raspberries and strawberries, with brighter touches of lime, and although the wine has a honeyed sweetness, it's zesty acidity makes it finish dry.",91,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Gloria Ferrer,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6354,Italy,"Made with Chardonnay, Pinot Nero and Pinot Bianco grapes from the Vigne di Strevi in Piedmont, this is a linear, genuine sparkler with lemon-lime flavors and toasted bread notes that come through loud and clear. Easy to drink and easy to like. Imported by Banfi Vintners.",89,24.0,Sparkling Blend,Banfi,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

6357,US,"Made from Pinot Noir, this bubbly is quite dark in color, and those Pinot flavors of cherries, strawberries, cola and tea really star. As full-bodied as it is, the wine is effervescently delicate, and completely dry. Try with sushi.",88,25.0,Sparkling Blend,Schug,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6358,US,"Sugary sweet in orange, pineapple, peach and vanilla flavors, this bubbly is based on Chenin Blanc and Chardonnay, with other grape varieties contributing a minor role. It's clean, with fine acidity providing balance.",85,13.0,Sparkling Blend,Korbel,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6359,Italy,"This classic sparkling wine has aromas of pears and white flowers plus an intriguing whiff of smoke. The palate delivers creamy peach and apricot flavors, along with hints of walnut and just-baked bread. It finishes dry, with notes of toasted oak.",90,30.0,Sparkling Blend,Bellavista,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6360,US,"This bubbly is rich in cherry and raspberry fruit, in addition to the usual sparkling wine notes of bread dough and smoke. It's a little sweet and scoury on the palate, but a fairly polished sparkler for this price.",86,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Gloria Ferrer,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6361,US,"The aroma's fresh, clean and yeasty on this young nonvintage, brut-style sparkler. In the mouth, it's a little rough in texture, with forward flavors of peaches and limes. Give it a few years to begin softening.",87,45.0,Sparkling Blend,Codorníu Napa,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6362,Spain,"Dusty lemon and cidery aromas are solid and draw you in. The palate has a fresh, clean feel and lively, tangy flavors of citrus, green fruits and green herbs.

6363,France,"This is in Pommery's relatively delicate style, a finely balanced, elegant Champagne. It has some lively acidity; the balance between this and the white fruits and touch of maturity works. Great non-vintage.",90,42.0,Champagne Blend,Pommery,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6364,Italy,"This easy but elegant sparkler offers candy-like aromas of butterscotch and caramel followed by apricot and dried fruit. The wine is firm and tonic in the mouth with thick consistency and a crisp, cleansing finish.",90,25.0,Sparkling Blend,Montenisa,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6365,France,"This wine shows a richer, smoother mouthfeel than others of its ilk. The nose is nicely toasty, with tropical fruit aromas and mint. Flavors are similar, dealing out nicely oaked fruit that goes down easily.",87,16.0,Sparkling Blend,Jaillance,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6366,Germany,"Raumland's Marie-Luise is a blanc de noirs of 100% Pinot Noir that comes across as toasty and nutty on the nose and palate, without obvious red-berry fruitiness or the earthy, sous-bois complexity of the variety. That said, it is medium in body and does make for a nice glass of bottle-matured sparkling.",85,39.0,Sparkling Blend,Raumland,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6367,Italy,"Cuvée Prestige has a fragrance of toasted bread crust, apple and pear. The creamy palate has a great depth of flavors: Golden Delicious apple, lemon drop, honey and pastry. The wine finishes on an almond note.",90,40.0,Sparkling Blend,Ca' del Bosco,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

6371,US,"A Chardonnay-based sparkler, this rich and concentrated wine has a luscious mix of apricot, peach and papaya fruit flavors in a creamy, textural setting. Exceptional length and development in the glass, which keeps bringing in nuances such as vanilla and pepper.",90,14.0,Sparkling Blend,Treveri Cellars,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

6374,Spain,"Funky aromas of nutty, briny citrus fruits and apple come with a whiff of skunk. This is flat in feel, with sugary, creamy flavors of green melon. A foamy, flowery finish tastes candied and feels borderline cloying.",83,14.0,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6375,Spain,"The palate touches both the sweet and sour, as it offers green apple and then candied white fruit flavors. The feel is a touch flat and pithy, but all in all it shows what it should.",86,13.0,Sparkling Blend,Vega Barcelona,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6376,Australia,"Despite being a relatively recent vintage, this wine shows mature, mushroomy aromas and its flavors possess slightly meaty overtones, somewhat similar to beef stock. Those complex, savory notes are a definite plus, and should make this otherwise light-bodied sparkler versatile at the table. Drink now.",87,30.0,Champagne Blend,Petaluma,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6377,Spain,"A bit more rubbery and hard than in the past, with a foamy palate feel and burnt flavors that hint at grilled melon and papaya. Seems sort of lazy and mealy on the finish, and overall it doesn't click past o.k.",83,10.0,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6378,France,"This lively, raspberry- and red-currant-flavored wine has just the right tang of acidity to create its crisp feel. Fruity and fragrant, it features a touch of minerality to add further texture.",87,20.0,Sparkling Blend,Pierre Sparr,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

6380,Spain,"Gasssy, soda-like aromas are the greeting, however there are decent red-fruit scents in the backdrop. This is a bit sticky and foamy on the tongue, with loud nectarine and cherry flavors.

6383,US,"A majority of Pinot Noir in this blend doesn't overshadow the Chardonnay's sentiments of baked apple, hazelnut and crème brûlée.

6384,South Africa,"This sparkler is sweet but attractive and balanced, with a lovely lychee, peach and rose water aromatic profile.

6385,Spain,"Crisp clean white-fruit aromas come with a hint of clover. This is mellow and mature on the palate, with nothing aggressive or edgy.

6386,Italy,"With an eye for all the commercial sweet-spots, this is a Rosato sparkling wine made primarily with the fragrant Moscato grape (with 15% Malvasia). The wine is sweet in a saccharine, artificial way.",82,13.0,Sparkling Blend,Tosti,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6387,Spain,"Clearly more serious than average, with light apple and honey aromas that are followed nicely by lime, apple and white-pepper flavors. Rather round, with freshness and a solid mouthfeel.

6388,France,"A creamy style of Champagne with a soft, nutty character. The green apple flavors give acidity that balances the rounded final character of this gentle Champagne.",87,60.0,Champagne Blend,J. de Telmont,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6389,France,"A fine vintage, which shows some age from a relatively fast-maturing year, but is now nicely poised between the initial fresh green fruits and grapefruit flavors, and the elements of toast and yeast that are developing well. This is a great food wine, with some weight and ripeness.",93,80.0,Champagne Blend,Pommery,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6390,Portugal,"Lovers of Moscato sparkling wines will enjoy this with its poise between sweetness and acidity. It is very fragrant, very refreshing, the sweetness never cloying.",87,14.0,Portuguese Sparkling,Borges,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6391,Spain,"White fruits, fennel and Serrano ham aromas create a sophisticated bouquet. This jabs away on the palate courtesy of citric acidity, while flavors of nectarine and citrus are good. It finishes dry and foamy.",89,46.0,Sparkling Blend,Alta Alella,Sparkling,2.0,1.0

6394,Spain,"Light and modest in aromas, although scents of citrus blossom and nectarine manage to work their way to the top of the bouquet. The palate is smooth and creamy, with flavors of red plum, melon and chocolate. A good wine that won't make you go crazy looking for complexities and depth.",85,14.0,Sparkling Blend,Bohigas,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
6395,France,"There is a curious imbalance here between Muscat's natural honey and very insistent acidity. The result is a wine that wants to be fresh, sweet and fruity, but doesn't fully succeed.",82,8.0,Sparkling Blend,Royal Muscato,Sparkling,2.0,1.0
